Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource Inc.s (NiSource) plans, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSources businesses, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, actual operating experience of acquired assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW EXECUTIVE SUMMARY NiSource generates nearly all of its net revenue through the sale, distribution, and storage of natural gas and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, which are rate regulated. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, and the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net revenues from gas and electric sales and transportation services are more significant than other months. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk. Currently, NiSource is in discussions with various regulatory bodies. This past year, NiSource implemented several creative agreements by working collaboratively with regulators and other key stakeholders, which provided value for our customers and shareholders. Ohio regulators have approved a surcharge, to begin in April 2004, that will allow Columbia of Ohio to recover previously uncollected bad debts, and will allow payment troubled customers to have the opportunity to participate in Customer CHOICE(sm) programs for the first time. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) offers one of the most successful gas utility choice programs in the nation. 14 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. However, the Ohio regulators have recently decided to modify parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the Customer CHOICE(sm) program and provide Columbia of Ohio customers rate certainty. The Company is likely to seek rehearing on the components that have been modified. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (CPA) received regulatory approval in October to recover certain costs of an affordable payment plan to low income gas customers with long term bill payment problems. This agreement should reduce CPAs arrearages and bad debt write offs going forward. Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Northern Indiana) received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) in 2003 to recover costs associated with environmental compliance programs for nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution reduction equipment at the companys generating stations. All regulatory matters are discussed in the segments section of the management discussion and analysis. NiSource has had many accomplishments in the current and recent years. The divestiture of major non core businesses, which allowed NiSource to reduce debt and business risk, and focus on the core, regulated assets, and the reduction of the dividend in November 2003 has helped NiSource affirm its investment grade credit rating with a stable outlook. In addition NiSource reduced interest expense during 2003 by $51.7 million as compared to last year, or 10 percent, by retiring $1.28 billion in debt and reissuing another $1.35 billion of debt at a lower rate. NiSource also downsized the revolving credit facility by $500 million and retired $345 million in mandatory redeemable preferred securities, which further reduced fixed charges. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. NiSource also completed the previously announced divestitures of non core assets, including the gas exploration and production unit, PEI Holdings Inc.s (PEI) steel related cogeneration assets and the telecommunications business. These sales generated about $305 million after taxes, plus the elimination of roughly $274 million of debt that was assumed by the buyers. This strengthened the balance sheet and lowered NiSources risk profile. NiSource will capitalize on the stable portfolio of virtually 100 percent regulated and strategically located gas and electric businesses. In addition, NiSource adopted a new organizational structure that will focus on the regulated, core businesses of strategically located gas and electric operations that generate virtually 100% of the companys operating income. Through this focus on operations and a new organizational structure, NiSource has been able to hold the line on operation and maintenance costs, despite increases in employee benefits and pension costs. Through these and many other efforts NiSource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of $1.64 per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. Going forward, NiSource will continue to build value and customer trust by capitalizing on its super regional utility and pipeline operations. NiSource will focus on: continuing to standardize its operations and focus on predictability and reliability; continuing to deliver the best possible service at the lowest cost; continuing to develop innovative ways to help our customers manage heating bills and gas price volatility, with products such as its fixed price option; continuing to find ways to control the cost of generating electricity; and pursuing projects that will bring long term attractively priced gas supplies to the market. Finally, NiSource has always been committed to accurate and complete financial reporting and requires a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of the Form 10 K. In addition, NiSource will continue our mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of our organization participate. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share, in 2002 and $191.0 million, or 93 cents per share in 2001. All per share amounts are based on basic weighted common shares outstanding. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or 33 cents per share, 2002 net income of $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share, and $216.2 million, or $1.05 per share for 2001. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60.1 million and modest increases in non traditional and non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.0 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were $3,070.9 million, a $55.9 million decrease compared with 2001. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales, incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling $41.5 million; credits totaling $28.1 million pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement; $12.9 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas. Offsetting the decrease was a $36.6 million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season, which increased natural gas sales and deliveries, and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,944.0 million in 2003, a $25.3 million increase from 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during the year included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased operating tax expense of $12.3 million consisting primarily of increased property taxes. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expense and the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners, Inc. for a gain of $16.6 million in third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million and a $10.0 million reversal in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating expenses of $1,918.7 million for 2002 decreased $240.2 million over 2001. A portion of the decrease was attributable to a $123.0 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related, support services and facilities expenses of $35.4 million resulting from reorganization initiatives; insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling $24.5 million; a reversal of $30.3 million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures; and a reduction of $16.8 million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The 2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the $15.5 million litigation settlement related to Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP). Also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of $93.1 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and $27.1 million primarily from gains on the sales of NiSources utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of TPCs gas trading contracts. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $535.2 million compared to a reduction of $610.3 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $75.6 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, and the sales of IWCR and SM&P. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate PIES, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $15.3 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 and increased $52.3 million in 2002 over 2001 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5%, 35.5 % and 46.6% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate after 2002 was primarily due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $331.7 million, or a loss of $1.28 per share, in 2003 compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or loss of 12 cents per share, in 2002 and income of $21.2 million, or 10 cents per share, in 2001. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of NiSources exploration and production properties, CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. 2001 results included income of $30.4 million from CER partly offset by a loss of $14.3 million from Transcom, which included an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. NiSource accounted for CER, six of the PEI subsidiaries, Transcom and water utility assets that were sold in 2002 as discontinued operations. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. The change in accounting in 2001 is a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on derivative accounting. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $472.9 million. Cash used for working capital was $430.7 million, principally driven by increased gas inventories and gas exchange receivables and decreased exchange gas payables, partly offset by lower accounts receivable and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10.0 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million. On December 18, 2003, $55.0 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes that mature May 4, 2005. The notes are callable, at par, at the option of NiSource on or after May 4, 2004. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750.0 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, "inside the fence" assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330.0 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR) sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95.0 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the November 4, 2003 debt offerings discussed previously herein, the Companys shelf capacity remains at $2.3 billion. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124.0 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300.0 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $75.0 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to 92 cents per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. However, the Ohio regulators have recently decided to modify parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the Customer CHOICE(sm) program and provide Columbia of Ohio customers rate certainty. The Company is likely to seek rehearing on the components that have been modified. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (CPA) received regulatory approval in October to recover certain costs of an affordable payment plan to low income gas customers with long term bill payment problems. This agreement should reduce CPAs arrearages and bad debt write offs going forward. Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Northern Indiana) received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) in 2003 to recover costs associated with environmental compliance programs for nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution reduction equipment at the companys generating stations. All regulatory matters are discussed in the segments section of the management discussion and analysis. NiSource has had many accomplishments in the current and recent years. The divestiture of major non core businesses, which allowed NiSource to reduce debt and business risk, and focus on the core, regulated assets, and the reduction of the dividend in November 2003 has helped NiSource affirm its investment grade credit rating with a stable outlook. In addition NiSource reduced interest expense during 2003 by $51.7 million as compared to last year, or 10 percent, by retiring $1.28 billion in debt and reissuing another $1.35 billion of debt at a lower rate. NiSource also downsized the revolving credit facility by $500 million and retired $345 million in mandatory redeemable preferred securities, which further reduced fixed charges. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. NiSource also completed the previously announced divestitures of non core assets, including the gas exploration and production unit, PEI Holdings Inc.s (PEI) steel related cogeneration assets and the telecommunications business. These sales generated about $305 million after taxes, plus the elimination of roughly $274 million of debt that was assumed by the buyers. This strengthened the balance sheet and lowered NiSources risk profile. NiSource will capitalize on the stable portfolio of virtually 100 percent regulated and strategically located gas and electric businesses. In addition, NiSource adopted a new organizational structure that will focus on the regulated, core businesses of strategically located gas and electric operations that generate virtually 100% of the companys operating income. Through this focus on operations and a new organizational structure, NiSource has been able to hold the line on operation and maintenance costs, despite increases in employee benefits and pension costs. Through these and many other efforts NiSource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of $1.64 per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. Going forward, NiSource will continue to build value and customer trust by capitalizing on its super regional utility and pipeline operations. NiSource will focus on: continuing to standardize its operations and focus on predictability and reliability; continuing to deliver the best possible service at the lowest cost; continuing to develop innovative ways to help our customers manage heating bills and gas price volatility, with products such as its fixed price option; continuing to find ways to control the cost of generating electricity; and pursuing projects that will bring long term attractively priced gas supplies to the market. Finally, NiSource has always been committed to accurate and complete financial reporting and requires a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of the Form 10 K. In addition, NiSource will continue our mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of our organization participate. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share, in 2002 and $191.0 million, or 93 cents per share in 2001. All per share amounts are based on basic weighted common shares outstanding. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or 33 cents per share, 2002 net income of $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share, and $216.2 million, or $1.05 per share for 2001. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60.1 million and modest increases in non traditional and non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.0 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were $3,070.9 million, a $55.9 million decrease compared with 2001. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales, incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling $41.5 million; credits totaling $28.1 million pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement; $12.9 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas. Offsetting the decrease was a $36.6 million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season, which increased natural gas sales and deliveries, and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,944.0 million in 2003, a $25.3 million increase from 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during the year included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased operating tax expense of $12.3 million consisting primarily of increased property taxes. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expense and the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners, Inc. for a gain of $16.6 million in third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million and a $10.0 million reversal in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating expenses of $1,918.7 million for 2002 decreased $240.2 million over 2001. A portion of the decrease was attributable to a $123.0 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related, support services and facilities expenses of $35.4 million resulting from reorganization initiatives; insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling $24.5 million; a reversal of $30.3 million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures; and a reduction of $16.8 million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The 2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the $15.5 million litigation settlement related to Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP). Also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of $93.1 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and $27.1 million primarily from gains on the sales of NiSources utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of TPCs gas trading contracts. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $535.2 million compared to a reduction of $610.3 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $75.6 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, and the sales of IWCR and SM&P. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate PIES, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $15.3 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 and increased $52.3 million in 2002 over 2001 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5%, 35.5 % and 46.6% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate after 2002 was primarily due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $331.7 million, or a loss of $1.28 per share, in 2003 compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or loss of 12 cents per share, in 2002 and income of $21.2 million, or 10 cents per share, in 2001. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of NiSources exploration and production properties, CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. 2001 results included income of $30.4 million from CER partly offset by a loss of $14.3 million from Transcom, which included an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. NiSource accounted for CER, six of the PEI subsidiaries, Transcom and water utility assets that were sold in 2002 as discontinued operations. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. The change in accounting in 2001 is a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on derivative accounting. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $472.9 million. Cash used for working capital was $430.7 million, principally driven by increased gas inventories and gas exchange receivables and decreased exchange gas payables, partly offset by lower accounts receivable and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10.0 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million. On December 18, 2003, $55.0 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes that mature May 4, 2005. The notes are callable, at par, at the option of NiSource on or after May 4, 2004. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750.0 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, "inside the fence" assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330.0 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR) sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95.0 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the November 4, 2003 debt offerings discussed previously herein, the Companys shelf capacity remains at $2.3 billion. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124.0 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300.0 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $75.0 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to 92 cents per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or 33 cents per share, 2002 net income of $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share, and $216.2 million, or $1.05 per share for 2001. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60.1 million and modest increases in non traditional and non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.0 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were $3,070.9 million, a $55.9 million decrease compared with 2001. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales, incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling $41.5 million; credits totaling $28.1 million pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement; $12.9 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas. Offsetting the decrease was a $36.6 million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season, which increased natural gas sales and deliveries, and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,944.0 million in 2003, a $25.3 million increase from 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during the year included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased operating tax expense of $12.3 million consisting primarily of increased property taxes. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expense and the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners, Inc. for a gain of $16.6 million in third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million and a $10.0 million reversal in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating expenses of $1,918.7 million for 2002 decreased $240.2 million over 2001. A portion of the decrease was attributable to a $123.0 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related, support services and facilities expenses of $35.4 million resulting from reorganization initiatives; insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling $24.5 million; a reversal of $30.3 million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures; and a reduction of $16.8 million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The 2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the $15.5 million litigation settlement related to Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP). Also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of $93.1 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and $27.1 million primarily from gains on the sales of NiSources utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of TPCs gas trading contracts. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $535.2 million compared to a reduction of $610.3 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $75.6 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, and the sales of IWCR and SM&P. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate PIES, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $15.3 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 and increased $52.3 million in 2002 over 2001 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5%, 35.5 % and 46.6% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate after 2002 was primarily due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $331.7 million, or a loss of $1.28 per share, in 2003 compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or loss of 12 cents per share, in 2002 and income of $21.2 million, or 10 cents per share, in 2001. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of NiSources exploration and production properties, CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. 2001 results included income of $30.4 million from CER partly offset by a loss of $14.3 million from Transcom, which included an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. NiSource accounted for CER, six of the PEI subsidiaries, Transcom and water utility assets that were sold in 2002 as discontinued operations. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. The change in accounting in 2001 is a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on derivative accounting. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $472.9 million. Cash used for working capital was $430.7 million, principally driven by increased gas inventories and gas exchange receivables and decreased exchange gas payables, partly offset by lower accounts receivable and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10.0 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million. On December 18, 2003, $55.0 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes that mature May 4, 2005. The notes are callable, at par, at the option of NiSource on or after May 4, 2004. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750.0 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, "inside the fence" assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330.0 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR) sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95.0 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the November 4, 2003 debt offerings discussed previously herein, the Companys shelf capacity remains at $2.3 billion. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124.0 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300.0 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $75.0 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to 92 cents per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $535.2 million compared to a reduction of $610.3 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $75.6 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, and the sales of IWCR and SM&P. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate PIES, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $15.3 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 and increased $52.3 million in 2002 over 2001 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5%, 35.5 % and 46.6% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate after 2002 was primarily due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $331.7 million, or a loss of $1.28 per share, in 2003 compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or loss of 12 cents per share, in 2002 and income of $21.2 million, or 10 cents per share, in 2001. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of NiSources exploration and production properties, CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. 2001 results included income of $30.4 million from CER partly offset by a loss of $14.3 million from Transcom, which included an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. NiSource accounted for CER, six of the PEI subsidiaries, Transcom and water utility assets that were sold in 2002 as discontinued operations. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. The change in accounting in 2001 is a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on derivative accounting. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $472.9 million. Cash used for working capital was $430.7 million, principally driven by increased gas inventories and gas exchange receivables and decreased exchange gas payables, partly offset by lower accounts receivable and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10.0 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million. On December 18, 2003, $55.0 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes that mature May 4, 2005. The notes are callable, at par, at the option of NiSource on or after May 4, 2004. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750.0 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, "inside the fence" assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330.0 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR) sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95.0 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the November 4, 2003 debt offerings discussed previously herein, the Companys shelf capacity remains at $2.3 billion. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124.0 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300.0 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $75.0 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to 92 cents per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10.0 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.5% and 7.6%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million. On December 18, 2003, $55.0 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes that mature May 4, 2005. The notes are callable, at par, at the option of NiSource on or after May 4, 2004. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750.0 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, "inside the fence" assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330.0 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR) sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95.0 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the November 4, 2003 debt offerings discussed previously herein, the Companys shelf capacity remains at $2.3 billion. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500.0 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124.0 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300.0 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $75.0 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to 92 cents per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. Credit Facilities Due to the companys strong liquidity position, NiSource elected not to renew its $500.0 million 364 day credit facility, which expired on March 20, 2003. The 364 day credit facility was used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As a result of the 364 day facility expiring, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in aggregate letters of credit outstanding from $150.0 million to $500.0 million. The recent reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the $734.9 million of net proceeds from the equity offering during November 2002, the Corporate PIES remarketing, the sale of the exploration and production properties, the sale of PEIs assets and net cash flow from continuing operations. NiSource currently anticipates that its $1.25 billion 3 year credit facility expiring March 23, 2004 will be replaced during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364 day facility and a 3 year facility. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and $150.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 2.25%. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, and credit facility advances of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NiSource had $121.4 million and $171.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $443.1 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. In addition, NiSource had standby letters of credit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 issued under another credit facility. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. These covenants are not expected to change materially under NiSources current renewal of the credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2003, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10.0% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50.0 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5.0 to $50.0 million, and limitations 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5.0% or 10.0% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

Sale of Trade Receivables Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, with the exception of certain low income payment plan receivables, as they originate, to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement under which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2003, $89.5 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CARC. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the administrative agent for the program, has informed Columbia of Ohio that, CIBC and its commercial paper conduit entities will let all existing receivable securitization agreements expire in the normal course of business. As such, the Columbia of Ohio receivables program with CIBC will terminate on May 15, 2004 and Columbia of Ohio plans to initiate a new program with a new agent and conduit purchaser. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreements expire in December 2004. As of December 31, 2003, $166.8 million of accounts receivable had been sold by NRC. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now "stable". On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB+ rating for Columbia. Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB+ due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain TPC electric trading agreements contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $48.0 million to $53.0 million. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $184.3 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $184.3 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to these transactions was $103.2 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2004. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2003 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Long term debt $6,109.7 $ 118.0 $1,550.5 $ 430.5 $ 370.9 $ 33.5 $3,606.3 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 3.3 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.0 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Operating leases 207.8 39.0 33.2 30.3 26.5 22.3 56.5 Purchase obligations 1,151.7 210.7 168.6 123.4 106.2 96.0 446.8 Total contractual obligations $7,474.5 $ 368.9 $1,753.5 $ 585.5 $ 504.6 $ 152.1 $4,109.9 NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2004, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of $890.1 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $18.1 million to its pension plans and $51.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2004. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2004. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2003, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Lines of credit $ 685.5 $ 685.5 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 126.3 20.4 1.5 0.1 1.1 103.2 Guarantees 5,820.8 542.9 1,334.6 1,089.6 71.9 77.3 2,704.5 Total commercial commitments $6,632.6 $1,248.8 $1,336.1 $1,089.7 $ 73.0 $ 180.5 $2,704.5 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2003 and 2002 and an estimate for year 2004: (in millions) 2004E 2003 2002 Gas Distribution Operations $ 210.2 $ 195.1 $ 196.4 Transmission & Storage Operations 138.5 120.5 128.0 Electric Operations 144.7 225.1 197.8 Other Operations 25.2 31.8 5.3 Total $ 518.6 $ 572.5 $ 527.5 For 2003, capital expenditures were $572.5 million, an increase of $45.0 million over 2002. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2003 included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new business initiatives. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. While the NOx expenditures are being funded with cash from operations, a portion will be recovered over time through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The Other Operations segment primarily reflects capital spending for enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvements. For 2004, the projected capital program is expected to be $518.6 million, which is a decrease of 9%, or $53.9 million, from capital expenditures in 2003. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Pension Funding Due to the upswing in the equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets has increased since September 30, 2002. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods. However, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plans assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease approximately $19.2 million from the amount recognized in 2003. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. At December 31, 2003, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $685.5 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. The principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at December 31, 2003 was $1,163.0 million. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2003 and 2002, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $13.6 million and $17.5 million for the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 22, 2003, NiSource entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500.0 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either April 15, 2008 or April 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100.0 million. NiSource received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. The swaps contain mirror image call provisions that allow the counterparties to cancel the agreements beginning November 28, 2005 through the stated maturity date. In addition, each party has the one time right to cancel the swaps on September 5, 2007 at mid market. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale.

Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2003, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2003 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2003 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (5.4) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 3.7 Other changes in fair values during the period 0.2 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (1.5) (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.3) $ $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (0.8) (0.4) Total fair values $ (1.1) $ (0.4) $ $ $ $ 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $1.3 million and effectively zero, during 2003, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million during 2003, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 1 and 7, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.5 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7, Risk Management Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $16.5 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Asset and Extinguishments of Liabilities." In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $927.7 million and $1,199.0 million at December 31, 2003, and $953.2 million and $156.8 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, refer to SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" under this Item 7 heading titled, "Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements". In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $153.3 million at December 31, 2003. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $166.8 million of price risk management assets and $13.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at December 31, 2003. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $91.7 million at December 31, 2003. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $1.5 million. At December 31, 2003, NiSources balance sheet contained $21.9 million of price risk management assets and $23.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Changes and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES", AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 137, SFAS NO. 138 AND SFAS NO. 149 (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS SFAS NO. 133). Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS 149. These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 03 ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND EITF ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. On October 25, 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus in EITF No. 02 03 that gains and losses (realized or unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. For purposes of the consensus, energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on, or exposure to, shifts in market prices. This consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Upon implementation of EITF No. 02 03 in 2003, NiSource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus. EITF No. 02 03 implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of $945.4 million, $2,910.8 million and $2,214.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Accordingly, NiSources operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented. SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. NiSource adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of $54.3 million was recognized, of which $43.4 was related to assets sold in 2003. In addition, NiSource capitalized $41.3 million in additions to plant assets, net of accumulated amortization, of which $21.7 million was related to assets sold in 2003, and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. NiSource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates. The cumulative after tax effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 amounted to $8.8 million. Certain costs of removal that have been, and continue to be, included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries, did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to SFAS No. 143. The amount of the other costs of removal was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates. NiSource reclassified its cost of removal as of December 31, 2002 from accumulated depreciation 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, NiSource recognized accretion expense of $0.6 million. The asset retirement obligations liability totaled $11.4 million at December 31, 2003. Had NiSource adopted SFAS No. 143 at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred, the asset retirement obligations liability would have been $49.4 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which $38.3 million and $34.6 million were related to assets sold in 2003. Additionally, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 5 of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and Columbia Energy Resources. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities." As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain Nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Power Outage in the Northeast On August 14, 2003, a massive power outage affected approximately 50.0 million people in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Canada and completely darkened major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Cleveland, Detroit and Toronto. Northern Indianas electric system operated as it was designed and separated its system from the affected blackout area. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2003, NiSource had 8,614 employees of which 3,351 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. On May 31, 2004, the contracts with Northern Indianas bargaining unit employees expire. Discussions between Northern Indiana and bargaining units union representatives are ongoing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information With the sale of the exploration and production business, NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 29 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale.

Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution Operations accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations were $5.6 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $3.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these "CHOICE(R)" programs for their retail customers. Through December 2003, approximately 0.8 million of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer Customer Choice(SM) opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While Customer Choice(SM) programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. The majority of Columbia of Ohios contracts with interstate pipelines expire in October 2004, and the amended stipulation would permit Columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also: (1) extend Columbia of Ohios CHOICE(R) program through October 2010; (2) provide Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE(R) program; and, (3) allow Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from Columbia Gas of Ohio and a collaborative of parties. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE (R) program. However, the order limited the time period of the stipulation through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE (R) program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales. The order allows Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after October 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. Although this order will have a minimal impact on 2004, NiSources initial estimate is that this order, if left unchanged, could potentially reduce operating income by approximately $20 million annually 2005 through 2007. Columbia Gas of Ohio anticipates, consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS As part of the 2002 annual review of Columbia of Ohios gas cost recovery rates, the PUCO retained Exeter Associates, Inc. ("Exeter") to conduct a management/performance review of Columbia of Ohios gas purchasing practices and strategies. On July 25, 2003, Exeter filed its final audit report. In the audit report Exeter questioned Columbia of Ohios decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio should contract for only that post October 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers, to meet the balancing requirements of CHOICE(R) customers, and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of CHOICE(R) suppliers. According to Exeter, this approach would eliminate the need for Columbia of Ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs. Exeter also criticized Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders, which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the PUCO. Exeter therefore recommended that Columbia of Ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised. Exeter further criticized Columbia of Ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges, and recommended that Columbia of Ohio redesign its balancing rates. The issues raised in the Exeter report will be resolved by the PUCO either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. The approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of $25.2 million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for Columbia of Ohio. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the approved procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2002 on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. On September 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in March 2003 and reducing recovery by $3.8 million. On October 8, 2003, the IURC approved the demand component of the adjustment factor. Northern Indiana made its annual filing for 2003 on August 26, 2003. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. NiSource expects the proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the gas cost incentive mechanism program, which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of 2004, under the current settlement approved by the IURC. NiSource expects the program to continue after 2004. Effective November 2003, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a surcharge allowing CPA. to recover certain expenses related to Columbias Customer Assistance Program for low income customers. The Customer Assistance Program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150% of the poverty level. The estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is $11.5 million annually. However, the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas. Approximately $1.8 million is reflected in the year ended December 31, 2003. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Customer Assistance Surcharge on October 30, 2003, subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Market Conditions An economic slowdown during 2001, which has extended through 2003, contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy. Spot prices for the winter of 2002 2003 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range with a large spike toward $10 in February, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering the 2002 2003 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) since the EIA began recording such data in 1976. Throughout the summer of 2003, prices stayed between $4.50 and $5.50/Dth. Thus far during the winter of 2003 2004 price levels are between $5.00 and $7.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $195.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $210.2 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $85.6 million in 2003 and are expected to be $82.6 million in 2004. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2003 was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60.1 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was 7% warmer than normal. However, weather conditions were 6% colder than for the year ended December 31, 2001, which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately $21.8 million over 2001. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 878.9 million dekatherms (MDth), compared to 924.2 MDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Total volumes sold and transported of 924.2 MDth for 2002 decreased 82.6 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of $60.1 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased non traditional revenues of $8.6 million and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by a $21.8 million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase consisted of $21.8 million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses. These lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. 34 ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7.

Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

These services are provided primarily to local distribution companies (LDC), and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order No. 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. Several LDCs have effectively extended their long term capacity commitments and the companies are in the process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560,000 Dth per day to three electric generating facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. Initial service to a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland began in November 2003 under contracts providing up to 270,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario, trading hub. The Millennium partnership recently announced its intention to develop the project in two phases. Phase 1 of the project, subject to demand, is expected to be in service by November 2006 and will include the 186 mile section from Corning, N.Y. to Ramapo, N.Y., transporting 500,000 Dth per day. Millenniums upstream link will be via the Empire State Pipeline, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly to near Syracuse. Empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. This will provide a continuous link between Canadian gas supplies and the Millennium Pipeline with a capacity of at least 250,000 Dth per day. Assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues discussed below, plans call for the 46 mile Millennium Phase 2 to cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market via the Consolidated Edison distribution system. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 13, 2004. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent, location, and timing of their needs and anticipates filing, later in 2004, to amend its FERC certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Regulatory Matters On February 28, 2003, Columbia Transmission filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certain scheduled annual rate adjustments, designated as the Transportation Costs Rate Adjustment (TCRA), Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM), and Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA). These filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by Columbia Transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors (TCRA and EPCA, respectively), as well as quantities of gas required by Columbia Transmission to operate its pipeline system (RAM). The recovery of each of these costs is done through a "tracker" which ensures recovery of only actual expenses. On October 1, 2003, FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions compliance filing supporting its TCRA filing, and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing. On February 11, 2004, FERC approved an order regarding the annual EPCA filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. The FERC has not yet issued a final Order in Columbia Transmissions 2003 RAM proceeding. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments made in 2003 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $8.3 million. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $1.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7.

As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 0.8 MDth, 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $1.6 million, $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, of 2002 management negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. Columbia Transmission is in discussions with the counterparty about its failure to make a $500,000 payment that was due on January 1, 2004. A notice of default was sent on February 10, 2004. The counterparty has until March 11, 2004 to make this payment or Columbia Transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the agreement. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the note was $9.2 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $120.5 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $138.5 million in 2004. New business initiatives totaled approximately $16.2 million in 2003. Only $3.1 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed Millennium project. The remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout 2003. Also, contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore natural gas production. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001 period. Operating Income Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period, compared with the 2001 period, expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 38 ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7.

As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV) and Bethlehem Steel, which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. The steel sector continues to show improvement, with a 6% improvement in sales for 2003 over 2002. The acquisitions of Bethlehem Steel and National Steel by ISG and U.S. Steel, respectively, have been completed. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Payments of $0.6 million were made in 2003 in respect of the reorganization initiatives mentioned above. Additionally, during 2003, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.1 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with $0.7 million remaining of restructuring liability at December 31, 2003. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers in 2003. The order adopting the settlement was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and fourteen residential customers. On October 14, 2003, the Appeals Court upheld the IURCs approval of the settlement. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers have filed a petition for transfer to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause (FAC) filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which included a calculation for the sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2003 rejecting Northern Indianas sharing calculation, which prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit, was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana filed a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order. On March 12, 2003, the IURC denied Northern Indianas request and the appropriate amount has been refunded to customers. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the ITC signed an agreement with MISO. At its April 30, 2003 meeting, FERC approved the transfer of functional control of Northern Indianas transmission system to the ITC and issued an order addressing the pricing of electric transmission. An IURC order approving the transfer of functional control of the transmission system to the ITC was issued on September 24, 2003. An uncontested settlement that authorized the reimbursement of $7.4 million to Northern Indiana for incurred costs was approved by the FERC on July 31, 2003. This reimbursement was received on September 30, 2003. Functional control was transferred to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. A hearing at the IURC is scheduled for March 15, 2004. 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004. Northern Indiana has requested proposals for outside companies to provide power under varying terms and conditions. These proposals are being evaluated. In February 2004, the city of Gary announced an interest to acquire the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. Northern Indiana expects to discuss the proposal to acquire the land with the city of Gary in the near future. To date, the city has not commenced any legal proceedings. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). The IURC order was appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, where it was upheld by the Court on March 9, 2004. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana has 30 days from the date of that decision to petition the Court of Appeals for rehearing or the Supreme Court of Indiana for transfer of the case to that court. Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana made its initial filing of the ECRM, ECR 1, in February 2003 for capital expenditures of $58.4 million. On April 30, 2003, the IURC issued an order approving the ECRM filing, providing for the collection of funds expended during construction and a return on the capital investment through increased rates beginning with the May 2003 customer bills. Through December 31, 2003 the ECRM revenues amounted to $5.2 million. On August 1, Northern Indiana filed ECR 2 for capital investments of $120.0 million. This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $225.1 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately $144.7 million in 2004. Expenditures for 2003 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2004 are approximately $26.4 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Electric Operations sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due primarily to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of $21.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Electric Operations net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Operating Income Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a fair, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO filed detailed tariff information, with a planned initial operation date of March 31, 2004. However, in October 2003, MISO petitioned FERC to withdraw this tariff filing. FERC approved the withdrawal and has provided guidance to MISO as to how it should proceed in the future. It is now expected that MISO will file a new tariff application with FERC and will delay the initial operation date to December 1, 2004. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conducts their electric business; however, at this time management cannot determine the impact the MMI will have on Northern Indiana or TPC. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied costs associated with a specific interruptible sales tariff. An estimated refund liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2003. A settlement was reached with the customers and Northern Indiana recorded the full costs of the settlement. As a result of the settlement, the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges under the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) has been returned to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating station units and various options regarding the return of the Mitchell Station, constructed in the early 1950s, to service in the second half of 2004.

This petition was approved by the IURC on October 1, 2003. The initial filing of the EERM was filed with the most recent semi annual filing of the ECT in February 2004, which included a filing of the ECR 3 for capital investments of $194.1 million and an EERM amount of $1.9 million. Over the timeframe required to meet the environmental standards, Northern Indiana anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $274.2 million. On February 4, 2004, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $274.2 million. 41 ITEM 7.

The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses of $12.3 and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. 42 ITEM 7.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name "Primary Energy". Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operated an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. PEI Holdings, Inc. WHITING CLEAN ENERGY. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to seek recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications. The contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. PEI estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2003, the after tax loss was approximately $30.0 million and the expected 2004 after tax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for gas and electricity. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2003, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Footnote 17G "Environmental Matters" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0. For the year ended 2002, net operating revenues were $13.8 million, a decrease of $48.4 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. . (Refer to Footnote 5 for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Income (Loss) The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.1 million for 2002, an improvement of $26.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $13.9 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio.
