Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSource Inc.s (NiSource) plans, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSources businesses, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the scope, timing and impact of any outsourcing initiative, actual operating experience of NiSource assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW Executive Summary NiSource generates virtually 100% of the companys operating income through the sale, distribution, transportation and storage of natural gas and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, which are rate regulated. A significant portion of NiSources operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues from gas are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months. 4 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment. In 2003 and 2004, NiSource implemented several innovative agreements by working collaboratively with regulators and other key stakeholders. Ohio regulators approved an Uncollectible Expense Rider in 2003 that began in April 2004, which allowed Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) to recover previously uncollected bad debts from January 1, 2003 forward and also allowed payment troubled customers to have the opportunity to participate in CHOICE programs for the first time. In 2004, Ohio regulators modified parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the CHOICE program and provide Columbia of Ohio customers rate certainty. NiSources pipeline companies completed the renegotiation of most of their firm transportation and storage service contracts with their customers in 2004, as these contracts expired on October 31, 2004. In December 2004, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Northern Indiana) was granted approval by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to initiate a one year pilot program for low income energy assistance entitled, NIPSCO Winter Warmth which will be funded by a surcharge to customers and a Northern Indiana contribution. In 2003, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC to recover costs associated with environmental compliance programs for nitrogen oxide pollution reduction equipment at the companys generating stations for which Northern Indiana recorded revenues of $22.3 million in 2004 related to qualified capital and operating costs. Overall, NiSources regulatory strategies that were initiated in 2003 and 2004 have begun to produce returns and benefit both its customers and the company. All regulatory matters are discussed in the segment sections of the Management Discussion and Analysis. In addition to the regulatory initiatives, NiSource has closely controlled operation and maintenance costs and reduced debt and interest expense. With the focus on regulated operations and organizational structure, NiSource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of $1.63 per share for the year ended December 31, 2004. During 2004, total long and short term borrowings decreased $353.8 million. Additionally, interest expense was $60.8 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower long term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and 2004. NiSource currently anticipates that its $900 million of notes, due in November 2005, will be replaced with a new debt issue. In the fourth quarter of 2004, NiSource entered into forward swap arrangements to reduce its risk of rising interest rates relating to its anticipated refinancing of these notes in November 2005. Going forward, NiSource will continue to focus on the regulated, core businesses of strategically located gas and electric operations that generate virtually 100% of the companys operating income. NiSource will also continue to explore commercial and regulatory initiatives that benefit both customers and shareholders, invest in pipeline expansion and storage projects to bring additional gas supplies to key markets, improve the balance sheet and lower operating expenses. In addition to initiatives already underway, NiSource is exploring refinancing opportunities that could further reduce interest expense. Management is also evaluating initiatives to lower operation and maintenance costs. Outsourcing may be a part of a comprehensive approach to capture this opportunity. Financial results for 2005 are expected to be negatively impacted by some of these operational and financial initiatives, along with impacts of regulatory proceedings and pipeline re contracting that took place in 2004. Earnings per share from continuing operations could be $0.10 to $0.15 lower than 2004 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2005. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. 5 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Finally, NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2004, NiSource documented and tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by the annual report. Refer to Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of the Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $430.2 million, or $1.63 per share, compared to $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, in 2003 and $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share in 2002. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per share, 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per share, and $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share for 2002. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 6.8 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources Stock Appreciation Income Linked SecuritiesSM (SAILSSM) in November 2004, 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,055.7 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to last year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State). The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60 million and modest increases in non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.5 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. 6 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,983.7 million in 2004, a $39.7 million increase from 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. (Columbia Service Partners). Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Operating expenses of $1,944.0 million for 2003 increased $25.3 million over 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during 2003 included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement benefit expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased property tax expense of $12.3 million. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expenses, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable, and insurance recoveries and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $35.3 million. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners for a gain of $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in reserves for environmental expenditures and unaccounted for gas amounting to $20 million, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $400.9 million compared to a reduction of $456.4 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. Other, net decreased $7.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in 2004. Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $6.7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 and increased $15.3 million in 2003 over 2002 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.9%, 35.5%, and 35.5 % in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $6.1 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2004 compared to a loss of $331.7 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2003 and a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2002. The current years income from discontinued operations, after tax, is mostly the result of a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, Columbia Energy Resources, Inc. (CER). In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI Holdings, Inc. (PEI) subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. 7 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosures of the accompanying managements discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our 2003 and 2002 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as discussed in Note 23, Restatement of Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1,056.3 million, an increase of $488.1 million from a year ago. This change was due primarily to a use of approximately $432 million from working capital changes during the comparable 2003 period versus only a $7 million use this year. The 2003 impact to working capital resulted from a decrease of exchange gas payables that were accrued at the end of 2002 and the replacement of a lower cost inventory level with a significantly higher cost inventory level. Additionally, $44.8 million of cash was used during 2003 by businesses that were disposed of during that year. Investing Activities. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Financing Activities. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the $250 million of notes issued on November 4, 2003 and the $450 million of notes issued on November 23, 2004, both of which are discussed below, NiSources shelf capacity remains at $1.85 billion. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance Corp. (NiSource Finance) issued $450 million of 5 year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSSM. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSSM holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 8 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment. In 2003 and 2004, NiSource implemented several innovative agreements by working collaboratively with regulators and other key stakeholders. Ohio regulators approved an Uncollectible Expense Rider in 2003 that began in April 2004, which allowed Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) to recover previously uncollected bad debts from January 1, 2003 forward and also allowed payment troubled customers to have the opportunity to participate in CHOICE programs for the first time. In 2004, Ohio regulators modified parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the CHOICE program and provide Columbia of Ohio customers rate certainty. NiSources pipeline companies completed the renegotiation of most of their firm transportation and storage service contracts with their customers in 2004, as these contracts expired on October 31, 2004. In December 2004, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Northern Indiana) was granted approval by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to initiate a one year pilot program for low income energy assistance entitled, NIPSCO Winter Warmth which will be funded by a surcharge to customers and a Northern Indiana contribution. In 2003, Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC to recover costs associated with environmental compliance programs for nitrogen oxide pollution reduction equipment at the companys generating stations for which Northern Indiana recorded revenues of $22.3 million in 2004 related to qualified capital and operating costs. Overall, NiSources regulatory strategies that were initiated in 2003 and 2004 have begun to produce returns and benefit both its customers and the company. All regulatory matters are discussed in the segment sections of the Management Discussion and Analysis. In addition to the regulatory initiatives, NiSource has closely controlled operation and maintenance costs and reduced debt and interest expense. With the focus on regulated operations and organizational structure, NiSource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of $1.63 per share for the year ended December 31, 2004. During 2004, total long and short term borrowings decreased $353.8 million. Additionally, interest expense was $60.8 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower long term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and 2004. NiSource currently anticipates that its $900 million of notes, due in November 2005, will be replaced with a new debt issue. In the fourth quarter of 2004, NiSource entered into forward swap arrangements to reduce its risk of rising interest rates relating to its anticipated refinancing of these notes in November 2005. Going forward, NiSource will continue to focus on the regulated, core businesses of strategically located gas and electric operations that generate virtually 100% of the companys operating income. NiSource will also continue to explore commercial and regulatory initiatives that benefit both customers and shareholders, invest in pipeline expansion and storage projects to bring additional gas supplies to key markets, improve the balance sheet and lower operating expenses. In addition to initiatives already underway, NiSource is exploring refinancing opportunities that could further reduce interest expense. Management is also evaluating initiatives to lower operation and maintenance costs. Outsourcing may be a part of a comprehensive approach to capture this opportunity. Financial results for 2005 are expected to be negatively impacted by some of these operational and financial initiatives, along with impacts of regulatory proceedings and pipeline re contracting that took place in 2004. Earnings per share from continuing operations could be $0.10 to $0.15 lower than 2004 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2005. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. 5 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Finally, NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2004, NiSource documented and tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by the annual report. Refer to Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of the Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $430.2 million, or $1.63 per share, compared to $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, in 2003 and $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share in 2002. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per share, 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per share, and $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share for 2002. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 6.8 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources Stock Appreciation Income Linked SecuritiesSM (SAILSSM) in November 2004, 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,055.7 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to last year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State). The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60 million and modest increases in non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.5 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. 6 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,983.7 million in 2004, a $39.7 million increase from 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. (Columbia Service Partners). Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Operating expenses of $1,944.0 million for 2003 increased $25.3 million over 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during 2003 included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement benefit expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased property tax expense of $12.3 million. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expenses, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable, and insurance recoveries and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $35.3 million. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners for a gain of $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in reserves for environmental expenditures and unaccounted for gas amounting to $20 million, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $400.9 million compared to a reduction of $456.4 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. Other, net decreased $7.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in 2004. Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $6.7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 and increased $15.3 million in 2003 over 2002 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.9%, 35.5%, and 35.5 % in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $6.1 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2004 compared to a loss of $331.7 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2003 and a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2002. The current years income from discontinued operations, after tax, is mostly the result of a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, Columbia Energy Resources, Inc. (CER). In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI Holdings, Inc. (PEI) subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. 7 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosures of the accompanying managements discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our 2003 and 2002 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as discussed in Note 23, Restatement of Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1,056.3 million, an increase of $488.1 million from a year ago. This change was due primarily to a use of approximately $432 million from working capital changes during the comparable 2003 period versus only a $7 million use this year. The 2003 impact to working capital resulted from a decrease of exchange gas payables that were accrued at the end of 2002 and the replacement of a lower cost inventory level with a significantly higher cost inventory level. Additionally, $44.8 million of cash was used during 2003 by businesses that were disposed of during that year. Investing Activities. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Financing Activities. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the $250 million of notes issued on November 4, 2003 and the $450 million of notes issued on November 23, 2004, both of which are discussed below, NiSources shelf capacity remains at $1.85 billion. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance Corp. (NiSource Finance) issued $450 million of 5 year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSSM. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSSM holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 8 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Finally, NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2004, NiSource documented and tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by the annual report. Refer to Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of the Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $430.2 million, or $1.63 per share, compared to $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, in 2003 and $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share in 2002. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per share, 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per share, and $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share for 2002. Earnings per share are not comparable because of 6.8 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources Stock Appreciation Income Linked SecuritiesSM (SAILSSM) in November 2004, 13.1 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in February 2003 and an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,055.7 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to last year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State). The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $3,060.3 million, a $10.6 million decrease compared with 2002. Items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to $60 million and modest increases in non weather related volume of $15.4 million. These favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of $21.9 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season, lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of $19.7 million in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained, colder than normal weather, a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of $13.5 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities, and credits totaling $24.5 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. 6 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,983.7 million in 2004, a $39.7 million increase from 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. (Columbia Service Partners). Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Operating expenses of $1,944.0 million for 2003 increased $25.3 million over 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during 2003 included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement benefit expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased property tax expense of $12.3 million. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expenses, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable, and insurance recoveries and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $35.3 million. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners for a gain of $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in reserves for environmental expenditures and unaccounted for gas amounting to $20 million, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $400.9 million compared to a reduction of $456.4 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. Other, net decreased $7.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in 2004. Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $6.7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 and increased $15.3 million in 2003 over 2002 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.9%, 35.5%, and 35.5 % in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $6.1 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2004 compared to a loss of $331.7 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2003 and a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2002. The current years income from discontinued operations, after tax, is mostly the result of a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, Columbia Energy Resources, Inc. (CER). In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI Holdings, Inc. (PEI) subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. 7 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosures of the accompanying managements discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our 2003 and 2002 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as discussed in Note 23, Restatement of Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1,056.3 million, an increase of $488.1 million from a year ago. This change was due primarily to a use of approximately $432 million from working capital changes during the comparable 2003 period versus only a $7 million use this year. The 2003 impact to working capital resulted from a decrease of exchange gas payables that were accrued at the end of 2002 and the replacement of a lower cost inventory level with a significantly higher cost inventory level. Additionally, $44.8 million of cash was used during 2003 by businesses that were disposed of during that year. Investing Activities. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Financing Activities. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the $250 million of notes issued on November 4, 2003 and the $450 million of notes issued on November 23, 2004, both of which are discussed below, NiSources shelf capacity remains at $1.85 billion. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance Corp. (NiSource Finance) issued $450 million of 5 year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSSM. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSSM holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 8 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Expenses Operating expenses were $1,983.7 million in 2004, a $39.7 million increase from 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. (Columbia Service Partners). Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Operating expenses of $1,944.0 million for 2003 increased $25.3 million over 2002. Operating expense increases experienced during 2003 included $28.5 million in pension and post retirement benefit expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable expense amounting to $21.3 million, and increased property tax expense of $12.3 million. Expense reductions for 2003 include $27.5 million in reduced administrative and employee related expenses, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery of $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable, and insurance recoveries and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $35.3 million. In addition, NiSource sold Columbia Service Partners for a gain of $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 and Midtex Gas Storage for a gain of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period included $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, a reduction in reserves for environmental expenditures and unaccounted for gas amounting to $20 million, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $400.9 million compared to a reduction of $456.4 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. Other, net decreased $7.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in 2004. Other Income (Deductions) in 2003 reduced income $456.4 million compared to a reduction of $535.2 million in 2002. Interest expense, net decreased $51.7 million from 2002 primarily due to lower short term and long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $191 million from December 31, 2002. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities associated with the Corporate Premium Income Equity Securities (Corporate PIES), was $2.5 million in 2003 compared to $20.4 million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the Corporate PIES in February 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $6.7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 and increased $15.3 million in 2003 over 2002 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.9%, 35.5%, and 35.5 % in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $6.1 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2004 compared to a loss of $331.7 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2003 and a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2002. The current years income from discontinued operations, after tax, is mostly the result of a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, Columbia Energy Resources, Inc. (CER). In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI Holdings, Inc. (PEI) subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Columbia Transmission Communications Corporation (Transcom). The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. Change in Accounting The change in accounting in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of tax, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board statement on asset retirement obligations. 7 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosures of the accompanying managements discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our 2003 and 2002 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as discussed in Note 23, Restatement of Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1,056.3 million, an increase of $488.1 million from a year ago. This change was due primarily to a use of approximately $432 million from working capital changes during the comparable 2003 period versus only a $7 million use this year. The 2003 impact to working capital resulted from a decrease of exchange gas payables that were accrued at the end of 2002 and the replacement of a lower cost inventory level with a significantly higher cost inventory level. Additionally, $44.8 million of cash was used during 2003 by businesses that were disposed of during that year. Investing Activities. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Financing Activities. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the $250 million of notes issued on November 4, 2003 and the $450 million of notes issued on November 23, 2004, both of which are discussed below, NiSources shelf capacity remains at $1.85 billion. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance Corp. (NiSource Finance) issued $450 million of 5 year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSSM. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSSM holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 8 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Liquidity and Capital Resources disclosures of the accompanying managements discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement of our 2003 and 2002 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as discussed in Note 23, Restatement of Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1,056.3 million, an increase of $488.1 million from a year ago. This change was due primarily to a use of approximately $432 million from working capital changes during the comparable 2003 period versus only a $7 million use this year. The 2003 impact to working capital resulted from a decrease of exchange gas payables that were accrued at the end of 2002 and the replacement of a lower cost inventory level with a significantly higher cost inventory level. Additionally, $44.8 million of cash was used during 2003 by businesses that were disposed of during that year. Investing Activities. On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power, LLC (Private Power). The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $206.3 million. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $29.1 million related to the sale. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana Energy Holdings for $330 million, plus the assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Financing Activities. On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided the Company with an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. After the $250 million of notes issued on November 4, 2003 and the $450 million of notes issued on November 23, 2004, both of which are discussed below, NiSources shelf capacity remains at $1.85 billion. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance Corp. (NiSource Finance) issued $450 million of 5 year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSSM. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSSM holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 8 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSSM was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. (NiSource Capital Markets) redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.6 million, of which $4.2 million was charged to expense and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. On December 18, 2003, $55 million of new tax exempt Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were issued by Jasper County, Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana. The new tax exempt bonds were issued on an auction rate basis and bear interest at a floating rate as determined in 35 day increments by the tax exempt auction process. The proceeds of the bonds were loaned to Northern Indiana, pursuant to a financing agreement dated as of December 1, 2003, and were used to refund Northern Indianas $55 million aggregate principal amount of Jasper County, Indiana Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 1991. As a result of the refunding, the final series of First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under Northern Indianas First Mortgage Indenture were discharged, cancelled and returned to Northern Indiana. There are no longer any First Mortgage Bonds outstanding under the First Mortgage Indenture. Northern Indiana intends to obtain and file in due course in the appropriate recording offices in Indiana the releases necessary to remove the First Mortgage Indenture from the title records with respect to the Northern Indiana property formerly subject to the lien of the First Mortgage Indenture. On November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 18 month floating rate unsecured notes with a maturity date of May 4, 2005. The notes were subsequently called on December 10, 2004 at par value. Also on November 4, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $250 million of 3.20% three year unsecured notes that mature November 1, 2006. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finances $750 million notes, which matured on November 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, NiSource Finance issued $500 million of 5.40% eleven year senior unsecured notes that mature July 15, 2014. The proceeds were used to reduce other maturing debt and for working capital needs. During the time period of March 2003 through July 2003, Northern Indiana redeemed $124 million of Northern Indiana medium term notes. On April 15, 2003, NiSource Finance repaid at maturity $300 million of its 5.75% two year senior notes. On March 31, 2003, NiSource Capital Markets redeemed $75 million of its 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026. On July 8, 2003 NiSource announced that it would reduce its common stock dividend to $0.92 per share from $1.16 per share on an annual basis. This change took effect beginning with the dividend payable on November 20, 2003. The change in the dividend, the sale of non core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts have stabilized NiSources credit ratings, enhanced cash flows and provided funds to reinvest in NiSources core businesses for the future. NiSources decision was also influenced by the fact that its dividend yield and payout ratio prior to the dividend reduction were higher than industry averages. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed most of the underlying debentures, due February 19, 2005, and reset the interest rate to 4.25%. NiSource received net proceeds of $344.1 million from the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligations under the forward equity agreements. The sole purchaser of the remarketed debentures purchased newly offered 6.15% notes of NiSource Finance due March 1, 2013, using the remarketed debentures as consideration. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. 9 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Credit Facilities NiSource is currently in the process of renewing its $500 million 364 day credit facility, and plans to incorporate this facility and its $750 million 3 year facility into a combined $1.25 billion 5 year credit facility. The new facility is expected to close in March 2005 and will include sub limits for letters of credit of $500 million and swingline loans of $200 million. NiSource anticipates that a debt to capitalization financial covenant will be the only financial covenant required under this new facility. As of March 1, 2005, there are no borrowings under the existing facility. NiSource had short term cash investments of $146.1 million as of that date. During March 2004, NiSource obtained a new $500 million 364 day credit facility and a $750 million 3 year credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facilities replaced an expiring $1.25 billion credit facility. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%, and advances of $685.5 million at December 31, 2003, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NiSource had $111.6 million and $126.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2004, $89.4 million of the $111.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $22.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004, $18.2 million resided under NiSources 3 year credit facility and $4.0 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, $924.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Debt Covenants NiSource is subject to two financial covenants under both its existing 364 day and 3 year revolving credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, NiSource must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.75, as determined for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Additionally, NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 percent. As of December 31, 2004, NiSource was in compliance with these financial covenants. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to Columbia of Ohio Receivables Corporation (CORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit sponsored by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement, which replaced a prior similar agreement, expires in May 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, $137.7 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NIPSCO Receivables Corporation (NRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement will expire on December 26, 2005, but can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2004, NRC had sold $133.3 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings On July 8, 2003, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries, concluding a review for possible downgrade that began on May 13, 2003. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is now stable. On June 30, 2003, Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB rating for Columbia Energy Group (Columbia). Fitch also lowered the rating of Northern Indiana by one notch to BBB due to Fitchs policy of restricting the ratings between a parent and its subsidiaries where short term financing facilities are solely at the holding company level. This did not reflect weakening credit at Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On June 16, 2003, Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries was revised from negative to stable. Certain EnergyUSA TPC Corp. (TPC) electric trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $3 million to $5 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other electric or gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50 million to $55 million. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $71.1 million as of December 31, 2004, which decline over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $71.1 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $89.4 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2005. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services by NiSources Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2004 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Long term debt $ 6,207.2 $ 1,298.7 $ 438.3 $ 370.7 $ 33.5 $ 465.9 $ 3,600.1 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 1.5 0.9 0.6 Capital leases 2.6 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.9 Operating leases 273.7 46.5 44.5 39.1 33.9 26.8 82.9 Purchase obligations 1,121.3 212.5 162.4 142.5 112.4 87.9 403.6 Total contractual obligations $ 7,606.3 $ 1,559.0 $ 646.3 $ 552.7 $ 180.2 $ 580.6 $ 4,087.5 11 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSource has obligations associated with interest and tax payments. For 2005, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest and tax payments of approximately $990 million. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $3.6 million to its pension plans and $52.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2005. In addition, Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2005. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2004, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Lines of credit $ 307.6 $ 307.6 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 111.6 19.2 1.9 1.1 89.4 Guarantees 5,623.5 1,324.2 925.2 63.0 68.8 525.6 2,716.7 Total commercial commitments $ 6,042.7 $ 1,651.0 $ 927.1 $ 64.1 $ 158.2 $ 525.6 $ 2,716.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $3.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. Pension Funding Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2004, have increased for the second year in a row. Additionally, $18.2 million in employer contributions were made during 2004 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute $3.6 million in 2005 to certain pension plans and may provide additional funding for the pension obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term earnings rate assumption. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets, NiSource expects pension expense for 2005 to decrease approximately $3.6 million from the amount recognized in 2004. See Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2005: (in millions) 2005E 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 255.3 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission Storage Operations 206.3 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 128.1 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 33.9 10.9 31.8 Total $ 623.6 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. For 2004, capital expenditures and other investing activities were $523.4 million, a decrease of $49.1 million from 2003. This reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide (NOx) compliance. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. Electric Operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers. Capital expenditures in Other Operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. In 2004, Other Operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments. For 2005, the projected capital program is expected to be $623.6 million, which is $100.2 million higher than the 2004 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment and system upgrades in the Gas Distribution Operations segment to maintain service and reliability. The program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations. Increases in 2005 capital expenditures will be partly offset by a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors (VaR). VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC were no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced above, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2004 and 2003, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.5 million and $16.2 million for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. Entering into these hedge transactions allows NiSource Finance to mitigate the risk from rising interest rates and uncertain interest expense cash flows in the future. Assuming prevailing credit spreads in effect at the time the forward starting swaps were put in place, the swaps would result in a net effective interest rate of approximately 5.55% 5.65% for the planned 12 year note issuance and approximately 5.70% 5.80% for the planned 15 year note issuance. These approximate interest rates assume the relationship between swap spreads embedded in the forward starting swaps and NiSource Finances credit spread remain constant from execution date of the swaps through the planned notes issuance date anticipated in September 2005. Each of the forward starting swap transactions have both an effective date and a mandatory early termination date of September 7, 2005, which is the date NiSource Finance anticipates completing $900 million of new debt issuance, consisting of $450 million of 12 year notes and $450 million of 15 year notes. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month British Banker Association (BBA) London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On May 12, 2004, Columbia terminated all remaining fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, Columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus 2.66% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at inception of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, 2002, with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2004, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2004 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions at December 31) 2004 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (1.5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (8.6 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 7.5 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (3.0 ) (in millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Prices from other external sources $ (0.7 ) $ $ $ $ Prices based on models/other method (2.3 ) Total fair values $ (3.0 ) $ $ $ $ The caption Prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within Prices based on models/other method are generally valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.4 million and effectively zero, during 2004, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million during 2004, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $2.5 million for power trading and $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to this Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies, and Note 1 Q, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.2 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and have current annual charges approximating $17.2 million. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $998.4 million and $1,214.3 million at December 31, 2004, and $893.2 million and $1,164.5 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 D, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $174.5 million at December 31, 2004. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, and SFAS No. 149 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133,) the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $209.4 million and $188.7 million of price risk management assets and $52.4 million and $36.7 million of price risk management liabilities, all primarily related to hedges, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, was $93.9 million and $91.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of $3.0 million and a loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of $8.8 million and $21.9 million and price risk management liabilities of $11.9 million and $23.4 million, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 10, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, using a modified version of the prospective application. NiSource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant. For stock options granted during January 2005, the Company awarded stock options that vested immediately, but included a one year exercise restriction. Due to the one year vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in January 2005, no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to June 15, 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. However, any stock options awarded after June 15, 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods. NiSource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to NiSources financial position or results of operations for 2005. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). (Supersedes FSP 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.) On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in relevant laws to be considered in current period measurements of postretirement benefit costs and the Accumulated Projected Benefit Obligation. FSP 106 2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. NiSource had previously elected to defer accounting for the effects of this pronouncement, as allowed by FSP 106 1. On July 1, 2004, NiSource adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2. The impact of accounting for the federal subsidy was not material to NiSources financial position or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. On December 18, 2003, the FASB deferred the implementation of FIN 46R to the first quarter of 2004. As a result, NiSource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Upon consolidation, NiSource increased its long term debt by approximately $40 million. NiSource does not guarantee the debt payment of these low income housing real estate investments. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain local gas distribution companies and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2004, NiSource had 8,628 employees of which 3,361 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Northern Indiana reached an agreement with its bargaining unit employees to replace the contract agreements that expired May 31, 2004. The new agreements are for five years, expiring May 31, 2009. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within Gas Distribution Operations was $1.6 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.5 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $7.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, with $7.3 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, have broadened to retail customers at the state level. For many years, large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distribution Operations facilities for transportation services. Beginning in the mid 1990s, Gas Distribution Operations has provided these CHOICE programs for its retail customers. Through the month of December 2004, approximately 713 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While CHOICE programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution Operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future. Customer participation in some of these programs can leave the Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution Operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity. Gas Distribution Operations is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms, incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. Through October 2004, Columbia of Ohios rates were established by regulatory stipulation approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). On October 9, 2003, Columbia of Ohio and other parties filed with the PUCO an amended stipulation that would govern Columbia of Ohios regulatory framework from November 2004 through October 2010. Most of Columbia of Ohios volumetric capacity under contracts with interstate pipelines expired on October 31, 2004, and the amended stipulation would have provided Columbia of Ohio with guaranteed recovery of the costs of renewing those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to 100% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2005 and up to 95% of the design peak day requirements through October 31, 2010. Among other things, the amended stipulation would also have: (1) extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program from November 1, 2004 through October 2010; (2) provided Columbia of Ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the CHOICE program; and (3) allowed 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On March 11, 2004, the PUCO issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation. The order extended Columbia of Ohios CHOICE program through December 31, 2007 and declined to pre approve the amount of firm interstate pipeline capacity for which Columbia of Ohio could contract and receive assurance of cost recovery. In addition, the PUCO made other modifications which would limit Columbia of Ohios ability to generate revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs, including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio and changing the amount of revenues generated through off system sales or capacity release transactions. The order allowed Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and December 31, 2007, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. On April 9, 2004, Columbia of Ohio and other signatory parties to the stipulation (Joint Petitioners), consistent with standard regulatory process, petitioned the PUCO for rehearing on the components that were modified in the March 11 order. That same day the Office of the Ohio Consumers Counsel (OCC) also filed an application for rehearing, and argued that the PUCO should not have permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after October 2004, and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant. On April 19, 2004, the OCC filed a motion to dismiss the application for rehearing filed by Columbia of Ohio and other parties. On May 5, 2004, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing, in which it denied the OCCs motion to dismiss and its application for rehearing. The PUCO granted part of the joint application filed by Columbia of Ohio and others. The PUCO modified its previous orders. Specifically, it (1) revised the term of the stipulation so that it extends through October 31, 2008; (2) restored the mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the CHOICE program obtain 75% of their interstate pipeline capacity directly from Columbia of Ohio; and (3) revised the mechanism applicable to Columbia of Ohios sharing of off system sales and capacity release revenue. Under the revised off system sales/capacity release revenue sharing mechanism, Columbia of Ohio will begin sharing such revenue with the customers after the annual revenue exceeds $25 million, instead of $35 million as originally proposed in the stipulation. This order further permitted Columbia of Ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service between October 2004 and October 2008, and allowed the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant for that same time frame. Columbia of Ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the PUCOs modifications. Nevertheless, on May 14, 2004, the OCC filed a Second Application for Rehearing. Therein, the OCC argued that the Joint Petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing, and thus the PUCOs rehearing order was unlawful. The OCC also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the OCC was excluded. The OCC also continued to challenge the PUCOs treatment of off system sales and capacity release revenues, and post in service carrying charges and related deferrals. On June 3, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed its proposed tariffs and accounting. On June 9, 2004, the PUCO denied the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. On July 29, 2004, the OCC filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, contesting the PUCOs May 5, 2004 order on rehearing, which granted in part Columbia of Ohios joint application for rehearing, and the PUCOs June 9, 2004 order, denying the OCCs Second Application for Rehearing. Columbia of Ohio intervened in the appellate proceeding. The briefing process has been completed and the parties are waiting for the Supreme Court of Ohio to schedule oral arguments. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio local distribution companies (LDCs) to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Columbia of Ohio has $43 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the Ohio Power Siting Board, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. Columbia of Ohio also filed requests for waivers from certain of the Boards requirements. The waivers were approved on February 4, 2005. The application is currently pending, awaiting further Board action. On September 10, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement agreement among Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. (Columbia of Pennsylvania), The Office of Consumer Advocate, The Office of Small Business Advocate, The Office of Trial Staff, and Commercial Industrial Intervenors in Columbia of Pennsylvanias annual gas cost recovery proceeding. Under the Settlement Agreement, the signatory parties agreed to financial incentive mechanisms for off system sales and capacity release transactions performed by Columbia of Pennsylvania. Under the incentive mechanism, customers receive 100% of the total combined proceeds from off system sales and capacity release transactions up to a benchmark of $6 million. After the benchmark is reached, Columbia of Pennsylvania will retain 50% of proceeds from the transactions; however, Columbia of Pennsylvania may never retain more than 40% of the actual net proceeds generated from off system sales and capacity release transactions. The incentive mechanism began October 1, 2004 and ends on September 30, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible gas cost adjustment (GCA) mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA5 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2004, was made on August 26, 2003. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2003. On June 8, 2004, Northern Indiana and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) entered into a joint stipulation and agreement resolving all issues in GCA5. Among the settlement agreements provisions, Northern Indiana has agreed to return $3.8 million to its customers over a twelve month period following IURC approval, which occurred on August 18, 2004. An additional provision of the agreement extended the current Alternative Regulatory Plan (ARP), including Northern Indianas gas cost incentive mechanism, from the current expiration date of December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Northern Indianas GCA 6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC authorized the collection of the demand charge, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2004 on October 20, 2004. The IURC held an evidentiary hearing in this Cause on March 2, 2005. Northern Indiana expects the IURCs order in the second quarter of 2005. Northern Indiana, the OUCC, Testimonial Staff of the IURC, and the Marketer Group (a group which collectively represents marketers participating in Northern Indiana Choice) filed a Stipulation and Agreement with the IURC on October 12, 2004, that, among other things, extends the expiration date of the 1997 ARP to March 31, 2006. The agreement also grandfathers the terms of existing contracts that marketers have with Choice customers and establishes a scope for negotiations that Parties will follow when convening within the next several months to establish a long term resolution of ARP. The IURC hearing on this settlement was January 13, 2005 with an order expected in the first quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) On December 15, 2004, Northern Indiana obtained approval from the IURC to implement a low income energy assistance 1 year pilot program under the name NIPSCO Winter Warmth. Northern Indiana and the OUCC entered into and filed a settlement with the IURC on November 5, 2004. The agreement provides that Northern Indiana will collect from customers approximately $5.0 million over the respective 12 month period and contribute $0.7 million of company funds for a total of $5.7 million of energy assistance. Northern Indiana and the IURC will evaluate the success of NIPSCO Winter Warmth in 2005 to determine if it will become a permanent program. The Maine Public Utility Commission (Maine PUC) has opened an investigation into the cast iron distribution piping integrity of Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities). Northern Utilities has responded that its cast iron piping is operated in accordance with state and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations, and that it is replacing that piping in a safe, cost effective manner. Northern Utilities has estimated that replacement of its cast iron system on an accelerated basis would cost over $35 million. The company has asked the Maine PUC to assure recovery of the costs associated with the incremental rate base additions if the Maine PUC requires accelerated replacement. All of the Columbia distribution companies hold long term contracts for pipeline and storage services with its affiliate pipelines, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Transmission) and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), and a majority of those contracts expired on October 31, 2004. The Columbia distribution companies are comprised of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc. (Columbia of Virginia). Several distribution companies discussed their plan to renew pipeline and storage contracts with industry stakeholders to ensure the continued ability to serve the requirements of firm customers in a tightening capacity market. All contract negotiations between the distribution companies and Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf were resolved prior to the contracts expiring. In addition, certain contracts were subject to the approval of the respective state regulatory agencies. On April 29, 2004, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a request by Columbia of Pennsylvania to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Pennsylvanias storage contracts and approximately half of its pipeline contracts will be renewed for terms of fifteen years, while the remaining pipeline contracts will be renewed on a tiered basis for terms ranging from five to ten years. Columbia of Pennsylvania will also acquire additional capacity to meet customer requirements on peak days. In addition, on August 3, 2004, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a request by Columbia of Virginia to renew its pipeline and storage contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. Pursuant to this approval, Columbia of Virginias storage and pipeline contracts with Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf will be renewed for terms of fifteen years. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2003 2004 were in the $4.00 $6.00 per dekatherm (Dth) range in line with the prices experienced during the 2002 2003 winter season, except for the spike in prices experienced in late February through early March 2003. Entering the 2003 2004 winter season, storage levels were near the top of the five year range. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2003 2004 winter season left national storage levels near the mid point of the five year range. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) During the summer of 2004, prices ranged between $5.00 and $6.75/Dth, buoyed by production concerns, economic improvement and demand for gas fired electric generation, though storage stocks reached their highest recorded levels entering the winter heating season. Thus far during the winter of 2004 2005 price levels are between $6.00 and $8.00/Dth, though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average and those of the 2003 2004 winter. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $225.2 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $255.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $84.8 million in 2004 and are expected to be $92.5 million in 2005. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. In 2003, NiSource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001. This resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about 3.5%. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. In 2003, weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories was approximately 4% colder than normal and 8% colder than 2002, increasing net revenues by approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 898.5 million dekatherms (MMDth), compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2003 were 876.2 MMDth, compared to 924.2 MMDth for 2002. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately $33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. Net revenues for 2003 were $1,476.6 million, up $87.8 million from 2002, mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers of approximately $60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, increased revenues of $8.6 million from off system sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $440.3 million, a decrease of $66.1 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $30.1 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $506.4 million, an increase of $47.3 million over the same period in 2002. The increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio for the recovery $25.2 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of $14.5 million. These benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of $25.9 million, higher pension and postretirement expenses of $9.8 million, and $22.4 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents

These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately 7 years. These reductions are projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Proposed Millennium Pipeline Project The proposed Millennium Pipeline Project (Millennium), in which Columbia Transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator, will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the Dawn, Ontario trading hub. The project is now being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the Empire State Pipeline (Empire), an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, N.Y. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, N.Y. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original Millennium project and specified that Millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the Hudson River crossing plan is not consistent with the Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the U.S. Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the U.S. Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the U.S. Federal District Court on February 13, 2004. The procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005. During the second quarter of 2004, a NiSource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project. NiSource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004, KeySpan Millennium, L.L.C. (subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation) purchased the interest of Westcoast Energy Enterprises (U.S.), Inc. and Westcoast Energy (U.S.), L.L.C. (subsidiaries of Duke Energy Corporation). The other sponsors are Columbia Transmission and MCNIC Millennium Company (subsidiary of DTE Energy Company). Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage Company, L.L.C. (Hardy Storage), to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for Hardy Storage capacity. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC in 2005, with plans to begin construction later that year. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Regulatory Matters On February 11, 2004, the FERC issued an order regarding the annual Electric Power Cost Adjustment (EPCA) filing, which upheld Columbia Transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs, but required Columbia Transmission to implement a separate EPCA rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station. The order also limits Columbia Transmissions ability to prospectively discount its EPCA rates. On December 22, 2004, the FERC issued an order affirming 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Columbia Transmissions right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers. The FERC permitted Columbia Transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing. Management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact. On April 14, 2004 the FERC issued an order accepting Columbia Transmissions Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations. The FERC will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of Columbia Transmissions 2004 RAM filing, which became effective April 1, 2004, and is currently pending. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was $2.9 million. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was increased by $1.6 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space. The liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $5.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, with $5.0 million related to facility exit costs at December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $133.3 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $206.3 million in 2005. The increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage initiatives. The pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportations (DOT) recently issued Integrity Management Rule. The DOT Integrity Management Rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated, if required, within a 10 year period beginning December 2002. Compliance will entail extensive assessment, including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices, and facility replacement depending on test results. New business initiatives totaled approximately $17.6 million in 2004 and are projected to be $46.8 million in 2005. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,238.9 MMDth for 2003, compared to 1,314.3 MMDth in 2002. The decrease of 75.4 MMDth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators, which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high. Additionally, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput. Net Revenues Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is projecting a reduction of approximately $40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts, which represent approximately 5% of total Segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Net revenues were $837.3 million for 2003, a decrease of $37.1 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to $9.3 million of lower interruptible service revenues and $10.4 million of lower firm service revenues. The decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services. Firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields. The limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory, a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather. In addition, storage and transportation revenues decreased $13.5 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities. Operating Income Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. Operating income of $398.8 million in 2003 increased $0.5 million from 2002. The $37.1 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a $12.5 million reduction in employee related and administrative expense, an improvement to income of $11.0 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, and a $6.6 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of $10.0 million, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas, offset by $14.8 million of increased expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and $8.7 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents

On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) through participation in an independent transmission company (ITC). The MISO has initiated the Midwest Market Initiative (MMI), which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. Refer to the Regulatory Matters on the following two pages for a more detailed discussion of the MISO. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Northern Indianas Electric Operations has realized an improvement of sales to its industrial customers as a result of the turn around of the steel industry in Northern Indiana. Although steel demand remains firm, supply data might suggest that this demand is not strong. Customer inventory levels in 2004 are near an all time high. Increasing imports to the U.S. combined with customer perception that prices have peaked, have caused some buyers to hold off placing new orders until inventories come down. With regard to the steel industrys improved financial performance in 2004, the key factors have been (1) the major structural changes in the world economy, (2) higher steel demand and (3) the ongoing industry consolidation and restructuring. Restructuring Since 2000, NiSource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of Columbia. The restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs. In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In connection with the restructuring initiatives, a total of approximately 1,600 management, professional, administrative and technical positions throughout all NiSource segments have been identified for elimination. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1,560 employees throughout all NiSource segments had been terminated, of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004. Payments of effectively zero were made in 2004 in respect of the restructured items within Electric Operations. Additionally, during 2004, the restructuring reserve was decreased by $0.4 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs. The restructuring program for Electric Operations is substantially complete with a $0.3 million remaining liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2004. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Credits amounting to $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2004 and 2003, respectively. On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an ITC. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the ITC and MISO on October 1, 2003. As part of Northern Indianas use of MISOs transmission service, Northern Indiana will incur new categories of transmission charges based upon MISOs FERC approved tariff. One of the new categories of charges, Schedule 10, relates to the payment of administrative charges to MISO for its continuing management and operations of the transmission system. Northern Indiana filed a petition on September 30, 2003, with the IURC seeking approval to establish accounting treatment for the deferral of the Schedule 10 charges from MISO. On July 21, 2004, the IURC issued an order which denied Northern Indianas request for deferred accounting treatment for the MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees. Northern Indiana recorded a charge during the second quarter 2004 in the amount of $2.1 million related to the MISO administrative charges deferred through June 30, 2004, and recognized $1.6 million in MISO fees for the second half of 2004. The MISO Schedule 10 administrative fees are currently estimated to be approximately $3.1 million annually. On October 6, 2004, the IURC denied Northern Indianas Motion for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana has appealed the IURCs decision to the Indiana Appellate Court, where this matter is pending. The MISO has initiated the MMI, which will develop the structures and processes to be used to implement an electricity market for the MISO region. This MMI proposes non discriminatory transmission service, reliable grid operation, and the purchase and sale of electric energy in a competitive, efficient and non discriminatory manner. MISO has filed with the FERC detailed tariff information and all market systems will be operational for the mandatory trials until financially binding activities begin with the opening of the market for bids and offers on March 25, 2005, and the Real Time Market on April 1, 2005. Northern Indiana and TPC are actively pursuing roles in the MMI. At the current time, management believes that the MMI will change the manner in which Northern Indiana and TPC conduct their electric business. Specifically, this detailed tariff information proposes to manage system reliability through the use of a market based congestion management system. The proposal includes a 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) centralized dispatch platform, which will dispatch the most economic resources to meet load requirements efficiently and reliably in the MSO region. This FERC tariff uses Locational Marginal Pricing (i.e. the energy price for the next lowest priced megawatt available at each location within the MISO footprint). The tariff also allows for the allocation, auction or sale of Financial Transmission Rights, which are instruments that hedge against congestion costs occurring in the Day Ahead market. The MISO will perform a day ahead unit commitment and dispatch forecast for all resources in its market. The MISO will also perform the real time resource dispatch for resources under its control on a five minute basis. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause (FAC). The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. A group of industrial customers challenged the manner in which Northern Indiana applied such costs under a specific interruptible sales tariff. A settlement was reached with the customers and the industrial customers challenge was withdrawn and dismissed in January 2004. In addition, as a result of the settlement, Northern Indiana has sought and received approval by the IURC to reduce the charges applicable to the interruptible sales tariff. This reduction will remain in effect until the Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station (Mitchell Station) returns to service. Currently, Northern Indiana is reviewing options to meet the electric needs of its customers. This review includes an assessment of Northern Indianas oldest generating units, which includes the Mitchell Station. On October 8, 2004, Northern Indiana requested proposals from wholesale power marketers to provide power under varying terms and conditions. Northern Indiana received conforming bids, which are currently being evaluated. Decisions on purchased power will be made consistent with the start of the MMI. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. Northern Indiana has reached an agreement with the City of Gary that provides for a joint redevelopment process for the Mitchell Station where the City of Gary could ultimately receive ownership of the property provided that the City of Gary and Northern Indiana can find funding for the environmental cleanup cost associated with demolishing the facility. The agreement expressly provides that neither Northern Indiana nor its customers will be obligated to provide funds for the cleanup costs. The associated environmental cleanup costs are estimated to be between $38 million to $53 million. The proposed joint development agreement is currently under review by the IURC. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO and Grid America. A hearing in this matter was held December 1st and 2nd of 2004. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. On July 9, 2004, a verified joint petition was filed by PSI Energy, Inc., Indianapolis Power Light Company, Northern Indiana and Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., seeking approval of certain changes in operations that are likely to result from the MISOs implementation of energy markets, and for determination of the manner and timing of recovery of costs resulting from the MISOs implementation of standard market design mechanisms, such as the MISOs proposed real time and day ahead energy markets. The hearing in this matter was completed on February 11, 2005 and an IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). The ECT was approved by the IURC on November 26, 2002. Under the ECT Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an Environmental Expense Recovery Mechanism (EERM). Under the Commissions November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. Northern Indiana 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents

Because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices, an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The study indicated that, at that time, no impairment was necessary. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) However, the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40 year estimated useful life of the facility. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, such as forward prices for electricity and gas, volatility in the market, etc., could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility, which would result in a write down that could be significant. During the second quarter of 2003, PEIs wholly owned subsidiary Whiting Energy, LLC purchased the Whiting Clean Energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $27.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. For the year ended 2003, net operating revenues were $16.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of $11.7 million recorded in 2002 associated with NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, slightly offset by losses of $1.6 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in Whiting Clean Energy net revenues of $7.0 million. All results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis. Half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on a net basis. Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) currently anticipates a total capital investment amounting to approximately $305 million. This amount was filed in Northern Indianas latest compliance plan, which was approved by the IURC on January 19, 2005. The ECRM revenues amounted to $18.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and $24.0 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $1.2 million for 2004. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2004, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 G, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $154.0 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately $128.1 million in 2005. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for NOx compliance. Expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately $3.1 million for the NOx reduction program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days (CDD) were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the CDD were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of CDD on usage is greater. Electric Operations sales were 18,439.2 gwh for the year 2003, a decrease of 336.7 gwh compared to 2002. The decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season, partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and increased customer count. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $728.6 million for 2003, a decrease of $39.8 million from 2002, primarily as a result of $24.0 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately $22 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in non weather related usage and customer growth. Operating Income Operating income for 2004 was $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18.6 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $28.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million, $3.3 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain medium term notes, and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Operating income for 2003 was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of the above mentioned decreases in revenues, increased pension and post retirement expenses of $18.7 million and increased property tax expense of $9.6 million, partially offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses of $12.3 million and lower uncollectible accounts receivable expense of $4.6 million. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale, reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2004, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $32.8 million. The profitability of the Whiting project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, current negotiations with BP Amoco regarding steam requirements for BPs refinery, an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns.

Beginning July 1, 2002 NiSource exited the gas trading business. All gas marketing sales at NiSource after June 30, 2003 were reported on a gross basis pursuant to EITF 02 03. (Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on EITF 02 03.) Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSources interest in Mid Tex Gas Storage, LLP of $7.5 million, a reversal of a litigation reserve of $7.0 million relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in operating losses at Whiting Clean Energy. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of $11.4 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses of $9.8 million associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of TPC gas marketing contracts. 38 Table of Contents
