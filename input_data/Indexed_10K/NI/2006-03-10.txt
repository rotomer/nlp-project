Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSources plans, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSources businesses, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, the effectiveness of NiSources outsourcing initiative, actual operating experience of NiSources assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW Executive Summary NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in the high demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England. NiSource generates virtually 100 percent of its operating income through these rate regulated businesses. A significant portion of NiSources operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues from gas are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months. NiSource had been registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding company Act of 1935, as amended. On August 8, President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 into law which, among other things, effectively repealed the Public Utility Holding company Act of 1935. NiSource is now a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which was issued as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The effective date for this change was February 8, 2006. Through this new law, the FERC was granted many of the oversight provisions previously held by the SEC. For the year ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared with income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share, for 2004. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of $82.8 million of pre tax restructuring and transition costs incurred in connection with an outsourcing agreement with IBM initiated during 2005, a $108.6 million pre tax loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, asset impairment charges of $21.8 million and other factors discussed below. Operating results for 2005 were also adversely impacted by higher depreciation expense, primarily from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio; decreased usage of natural gas by utility customers, driven in part by higher gas prices; incremental costs associated with the MISO in NiSources Indiana electric market; and lower net revenues in the gas transmission and storage business due primarily to the 2004 renegotiation of contracts with NiSource pipelines major customers, net of remarketing activities. These impacts were partially offset by increases in net revenues from Gas Distribution and Electric Operations, primarily driven by favorable weather versus a year ago, regulatory initiatives including trackers and increased electric sales to residential and commercial customers, and improved results from Whiting Clean Energy. These factors are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Natural gas prices on the wholesale market hit all time highs in late 2005 due to a national imbalance between supply and demand that was complicated by the unusually active hurricane season. The higher natural gas prices contributed to lower natural gas usage by customers, which in turn affected NiSources results, particularly in Gas Distribution Operations. While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were disruptive, they did not cause severe damage to NiSources pipelines, and the costs of repairing damage to pipeline facilities did not have a material impact on NiSources 2005 results. Contributing to the decline in EPS was an increase in the average number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2005, compared to the year earlier, due primarily to the issuance of approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts associated with the SAILSsm on November 1, 2004. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSource made significant progress during 2005 on each of its four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth: expansion and commercial growth in the pipeline and storage business; regulatory and commercial initiatives; financial management; and process and expense management. Expansion and Commercial Growth in the Pipeline and Storage Business. NiSources Columbia Transmission launched an open season for a proposed expansion of its natural gas transmission system in the growing Mid Atlantic markets. This Eastern Market expansion is moving forward to a 2009 in service date, based on definitive agreements with four East Coast customers. The Eastern Market expansion is a development project to expand existing Mid Atlantic storage and transmission assets to provide almost 100,000 Dth/day of storage for eastern growth markets. Millennium, which is targeting a fourth quarter of 2007, in service date, filed an amended certificate application with the FERC in August 2005. Also in August, Millennium signed Consolidated Edison and KeySpan as anchor customers. The Hardy Storage project is on track to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in Hardy and Hampshire Counties, West Virginia. Hardy Storage, which is being jointly developed by Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont, filed its formal project application with the FERC in April 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction should begin as scheduled early in 2006 and storage injections by project customers are scheduled as early as the spring of 2007. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Regulatory and Commercial Initiatives. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment. During 2005, NiSource continued to make progress with regulatory and commercial initiatives. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. Refer to the Results and Discussion of Segment Operations for a complete discussion of Regulatory matters. Financial Management. During 2005, NiSource refinanced $2.4 billion in long term debt that will yield approximately $43 million in annual interest savings beginning in 2006. In September 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes on November 15, 2005. Additionally, on November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $900 million in senior notes, the proceeds of which, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance $1.1 billion of Columbia senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005. In March 2005, NiSource entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement to fund future working capital requirements and other corporate needs. The new five year agreement replaced previous agreements and reduced interest expense by approximately $0.5 million during 2005. It is expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $1.2 million annually beginning in 2006. In addition, NiSource put in place a new $300 million short term credit facility during November 2005. This new facility has significantly bolstered the companys liquidity position. NiSource ended the year with $626.5 million of unused credit facilities. Process and Expense Management. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. The 10 year agreement is expected to deliver approximately $395 million in net savings, after costs to achieve this transition and transformation of systems, in operating and capital costs across NiSources 15 primary operating subsidiaries over the course of the contract, as well as provide new tools and technology advances and enhanced service capabilities. Included in the transformation process during 2005 and 2006 are major projects in Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain, Gas Management, Operations and Meter to Cash. The identified net savings do not include efficiencies and other benefits from a three year project to implement common work management solutions (WMS) and geographical information systems (GIS) across operations. During December 2005 and extending into 2006, NiSource initiated a corporate streamlining effort that will include reducing office locations, realigning executive compensation and reducing executive positions. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. 2006 Outlook Consistent with the 2006 guidance included within the press release issued on January 31, 2006, NiSources 2006 projection for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52 basic earnings per share. This projection is based on typical assumptions such as normal weather, customer growth offsetting usage declines, and customary increases in costs such as depreciation, taxes and employee and administrative expenses. Other factors built into NiSources business plan include: the successful completion of key regulatory and commercial initiatives; achieving expected savings from the outsourcing to IBM; deferral of MISO costs beginning August 1, 2006, and modest deterioration of results from Whiting Clean Energy, which benefited from a strong market during the summer 2005 period. NiSource expects additional transition costs associated with the outsourcing initiative with IBM of approximately $14 $15 million, or 3 cents per basic share. This expectation is included in the earnings projection above. Higher natural gas prices that contributed to the natural gas usage decline during 2005 may continue to impact 2006 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2006. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Ethics and Controls NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2005, NiSource tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10 K. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared to $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share in 2004. Income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $426.9 million, or $1.64 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource reported 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share, 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per basic share, and 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per basic share. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $3,149.8 million, a $98.0 million increase compared with 2004. The change was driven by $64.3 million increase in Gas Distribution Operations net revenues, $34.9 million increase in Electric Operations net revenues and $20.4 million in increased net revenues from Other Operations, partially offset by decreased revenues of $21.9 million from Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 drove approximately $24 million and $27 million of the increases for Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations, respectively. Net revenues also improved due to overall increased regulatory and non regulatory tracker revenues of $33.6 million which are offset in operating expenses, increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric Operations contributing approximately $24.4 million, improved results from 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of $22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million, increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased $16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM. Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1 million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long term debt of $108.6 million during 2005 compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt during 2004 was the primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average long term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities. Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income. Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The effective date for this change was February 8, 2006. Through this new law, the FERC was granted many of the oversight provisions previously held by the SEC. For the year ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared with income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share, for 2004. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of $82.8 million of pre tax restructuring and transition costs incurred in connection with an outsourcing agreement with IBM initiated during 2005, a $108.6 million pre tax loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, asset impairment charges of $21.8 million and other factors discussed below. Operating results for 2005 were also adversely impacted by higher depreciation expense, primarily from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio; decreased usage of natural gas by utility customers, driven in part by higher gas prices; incremental costs associated with the MISO in NiSources Indiana electric market; and lower net revenues in the gas transmission and storage business due primarily to the 2004 renegotiation of contracts with NiSource pipelines major customers, net of remarketing activities. These impacts were partially offset by increases in net revenues from Gas Distribution and Electric Operations, primarily driven by favorable weather versus a year ago, regulatory initiatives including trackers and increased electric sales to residential and commercial customers, and improved results from Whiting Clean Energy. These factors are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Natural gas prices on the wholesale market hit all time highs in late 2005 due to a national imbalance between supply and demand that was complicated by the unusually active hurricane season. The higher natural gas prices contributed to lower natural gas usage by customers, which in turn affected NiSources results, particularly in Gas Distribution Operations. While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were disruptive, they did not cause severe damage to NiSources pipelines, and the costs of repairing damage to pipeline facilities did not have a material impact on NiSources 2005 results. Contributing to the decline in EPS was an increase in the average number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2005, compared to the year earlier, due primarily to the issuance of approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts associated with the SAILSsm on November 1, 2004. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSource made significant progress during 2005 on each of its four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth: expansion and commercial growth in the pipeline and storage business; regulatory and commercial initiatives; financial management; and process and expense management. Expansion and Commercial Growth in the Pipeline and Storage Business. NiSources Columbia Transmission launched an open season for a proposed expansion of its natural gas transmission system in the growing Mid Atlantic markets. This Eastern Market expansion is moving forward to a 2009 in service date, based on definitive agreements with four East Coast customers. The Eastern Market expansion is a development project to expand existing Mid Atlantic storage and transmission assets to provide almost 100,000 Dth/day of storage for eastern growth markets. Millennium, which is targeting a fourth quarter of 2007, in service date, filed an amended certificate application with the FERC in August 2005. Also in August, Millennium signed Consolidated Edison and KeySpan as anchor customers. The Hardy Storage project is on track to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in Hardy and Hampshire Counties, West Virginia. Hardy Storage, which is being jointly developed by Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont, filed its formal project application with the FERC in April 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction should begin as scheduled early in 2006 and storage injections by project customers are scheduled as early as the spring of 2007. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Regulatory and Commercial Initiatives. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment. During 2005, NiSource continued to make progress with regulatory and commercial initiatives. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. Refer to the Results and Discussion of Segment Operations for a complete discussion of Regulatory matters. Financial Management. During 2005, NiSource refinanced $2.4 billion in long term debt that will yield approximately $43 million in annual interest savings beginning in 2006. In September 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes on November 15, 2005. Additionally, on November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $900 million in senior notes, the proceeds of which, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance $1.1 billion of Columbia senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005. In March 2005, NiSource entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement to fund future working capital requirements and other corporate needs. The new five year agreement replaced previous agreements and reduced interest expense by approximately $0.5 million during 2005. It is expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $1.2 million annually beginning in 2006. In addition, NiSource put in place a new $300 million short term credit facility during November 2005. This new facility has significantly bolstered the companys liquidity position. NiSource ended the year with $626.5 million of unused credit facilities. Process and Expense Management. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. The 10 year agreement is expected to deliver approximately $395 million in net savings, after costs to achieve this transition and transformation of systems, in operating and capital costs across NiSources 15 primary operating subsidiaries over the course of the contract, as well as provide new tools and technology advances and enhanced service capabilities. Included in the transformation process during 2005 and 2006 are major projects in Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain, Gas Management, Operations and Meter to Cash. The identified net savings do not include efficiencies and other benefits from a three year project to implement common work management solutions (WMS) and geographical information systems (GIS) across operations. During December 2005 and extending into 2006, NiSource initiated a corporate streamlining effort that will include reducing office locations, realigning executive compensation and reducing executive positions. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. 2006 Outlook Consistent with the 2006 guidance included within the press release issued on January 31, 2006, NiSources 2006 projection for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52 basic earnings per share. This projection is based on typical assumptions such as normal weather, customer growth offsetting usage declines, and customary increases in costs such as depreciation, taxes and employee and administrative expenses. Other factors built into NiSources business plan include: the successful completion of key regulatory and commercial initiatives; achieving expected savings from the outsourcing to IBM; deferral of MISO costs beginning August 1, 2006, and modest deterioration of results from Whiting Clean Energy, which benefited from a strong market during the summer 2005 period. NiSource expects additional transition costs associated with the outsourcing initiative with IBM of approximately $14 $15 million, or 3 cents per basic share. This expectation is included in the earnings projection above. Higher natural gas prices that contributed to the natural gas usage decline during 2005 may continue to impact 2006 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2006. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Ethics and Controls NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2005, NiSource tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10 K. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared to $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share in 2004. Income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $426.9 million, or $1.64 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource reported 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share, 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per basic share, and 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per basic share. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $3,149.8 million, a $98.0 million increase compared with 2004. The change was driven by $64.3 million increase in Gas Distribution Operations net revenues, $34.9 million increase in Electric Operations net revenues and $20.4 million in increased net revenues from Other Operations, partially offset by decreased revenues of $21.9 million from Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 drove approximately $24 million and $27 million of the increases for Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations, respectively. Net revenues also improved due to overall increased regulatory and non regulatory tracker revenues of $33.6 million which are offset in operating expenses, increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric Operations contributing approximately $24.4 million, improved results from 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of $22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million, increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased $16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM. Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1 million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long term debt of $108.6 million during 2005 compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt during 2004 was the primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average long term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities. Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income. Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Regulatory and Commercial Initiatives. As a regulated company, NiSource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment. During 2005, NiSource continued to make progress with regulatory and commercial initiatives. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. Refer to the Results and Discussion of Segment Operations for a complete discussion of Regulatory matters. Financial Management. During 2005, NiSource refinanced $2.4 billion in long term debt that will yield approximately $43 million in annual interest savings beginning in 2006. In September 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes on November 15, 2005. Additionally, on November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $900 million in senior notes, the proceeds of which, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance $1.1 billion of Columbia senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005. In March 2005, NiSource entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement to fund future working capital requirements and other corporate needs. The new five year agreement replaced previous agreements and reduced interest expense by approximately $0.5 million during 2005. It is expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $1.2 million annually beginning in 2006. In addition, NiSource put in place a new $300 million short term credit facility during November 2005. This new facility has significantly bolstered the companys liquidity position. NiSource ended the year with $626.5 million of unused credit facilities. Process and Expense Management. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. The 10 year agreement is expected to deliver approximately $395 million in net savings, after costs to achieve this transition and transformation of systems, in operating and capital costs across NiSources 15 primary operating subsidiaries over the course of the contract, as well as provide new tools and technology advances and enhanced service capabilities. Included in the transformation process during 2005 and 2006 are major projects in Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain, Gas Management, Operations and Meter to Cash. The identified net savings do not include efficiencies and other benefits from a three year project to implement common work management solutions (WMS) and geographical information systems (GIS) across operations. During December 2005 and extending into 2006, NiSource initiated a corporate streamlining effort that will include reducing office locations, realigning executive compensation and reducing executive positions. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. 2006 Outlook Consistent with the 2006 guidance included within the press release issued on January 31, 2006, NiSources 2006 projection for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52 basic earnings per share. This projection is based on typical assumptions such as normal weather, customer growth offsetting usage declines, and customary increases in costs such as depreciation, taxes and employee and administrative expenses. Other factors built into NiSources business plan include: the successful completion of key regulatory and commercial initiatives; achieving expected savings from the outsourcing to IBM; deferral of MISO costs beginning August 1, 2006, and modest deterioration of results from Whiting Clean Energy, which benefited from a strong market during the summer 2005 period. NiSource expects additional transition costs associated with the outsourcing initiative with IBM of approximately $14 $15 million, or 3 cents per basic share. This expectation is included in the earnings projection above. Higher natural gas prices that contributed to the natural gas usage decline during 2005 may continue to impact 2006 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2006. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Ethics and Controls NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2005, NiSource tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10 K. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared to $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share in 2004. Income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $426.9 million, or $1.64 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource reported 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share, 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per basic share, and 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per basic share. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $3,149.8 million, a $98.0 million increase compared with 2004. The change was driven by $64.3 million increase in Gas Distribution Operations net revenues, $34.9 million increase in Electric Operations net revenues and $20.4 million in increased net revenues from Other Operations, partially offset by decreased revenues of $21.9 million from Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 drove approximately $24 million and $27 million of the increases for Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations, respectively. Net revenues also improved due to overall increased regulatory and non regulatory tracker revenues of $33.6 million which are offset in operating expenses, increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric Operations contributing approximately $24.4 million, improved results from 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of $22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million, increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased $16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM. Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1 million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long term debt of $108.6 million during 2005 compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt during 2004 was the primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average long term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities. Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income. Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. 2006 Outlook Consistent with the 2006 guidance included within the press release issued on January 31, 2006, NiSources 2006 projection for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52 basic earnings per share. This projection is based on typical assumptions such as normal weather, customer growth offsetting usage declines, and customary increases in costs such as depreciation, taxes and employee and administrative expenses. Other factors built into NiSources business plan include: the successful completion of key regulatory and commercial initiatives; achieving expected savings from the outsourcing to IBM; deferral of MISO costs beginning August 1, 2006, and modest deterioration of results from Whiting Clean Energy, which benefited from a strong market during the summer 2005 period. NiSource expects additional transition costs associated with the outsourcing initiative with IBM of approximately $14 $15 million, or 3 cents per basic share. This expectation is included in the earnings projection above. Higher natural gas prices that contributed to the natural gas usage decline during 2005 may continue to impact 2006 results. NiSource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2006. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Ethics and Controls NiSource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees. During 2005, NiSource tested all significant controls across its financial processes and NiSources management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10 K. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate. Results of Operations The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $283.6 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared to $431.0 million, or $1.63 per basic share in 2004. Income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $426.9 million, or $1.64 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle, NiSource reported 2005 net income of $306.5 million, or $1.13 per basic share, 2004 net income of $436.3 million, or $1.65 per basic share, and 2003 net income of $85.2 million, or $0.33 per basic share. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $3,149.8 million, a $98.0 million increase compared with 2004. The change was driven by $64.3 million increase in Gas Distribution Operations net revenues, $34.9 million increase in Electric Operations net revenues and $20.4 million in increased net revenues from Other Operations, partially offset by decreased revenues of $21.9 million from Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 drove approximately $24 million and $27 million of the increases for Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations, respectively. Net revenues also improved due to overall increased regulatory and non regulatory tracker revenues of $33.6 million which are offset in operating expenses, increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within Electric Operations contributing approximately $24.4 million, improved results from 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of $22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million, increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased $16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM. Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1 million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long term debt of $108.6 million during 2005 compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt during 2004 was the primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average long term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities. Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income. Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Whiting Clean Energy of $17.6 million, increased residential customers for Gas Distribution Operations contributing approximately $8 million, and $12.1 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas operations of approximately $33.1 million, lower Gas Transmission and Storage Operations revenues of $20.3 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, net of remarketing activities, and increases in the cost of service for Electric Operations associated with MISO amounting to $15.7 million. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $3,051.8 million, a $4.6 million decrease compared with 2003. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased $36.0 million, primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately $33 million compared to the previous year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products, releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to $33.1 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. The reduction in Gas Distribution Operations net revenue was partially offset by a $31.6 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003. This was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,197.0 million in 2005, a $222.7 million increase from 2004 due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of $124.7 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $36.6 million, higher other taxes of $36.1 million and an impairment and loss on sale of assets of $22.2 million during 2005 compared to a gain on sale of assets of $3.1 million in 2004. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to restructuring charges, including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge, transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM which totaled $82.8 million, increased expense for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 which are partly offset in revenues, increased tracked expenses of $33.6 million which are offset in revenues, and higher electric generation expenses of $7.2 million. Depreciation expense increased approximately $30 million as a result of the expiration in November 2004 of the prior Columbia of Ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts. The 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to $33.0 million, while gross receipts tax increased $16.0 million in 2005, which is offset in revenue. In addition, goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas was impaired by $10.9 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling $10.9 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with IBM. Operating expenses of $1,974.3 million for 2004 increased $40.2 million over 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable under the Columbia of Ohio bad debt tracker, and the reversal of legal, environmental, and other accrued expenses of approximately $40.5 million and a $16.6 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners. Operating expenses for 2004 were favorably impacted by a reduction in estimated property taxes of $29.3 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2005 reduced income $519.8 million compared to a reduction of $405.1 million in 2004. A loss on early extinguishment of long term debt of $108.6 million during 2005 compared to a $4.1 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt during 2004 was the primary reason for the increase in other deductions. Interest expense, net increased $17.1 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher short term interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average long term debt balances due to the prefunding of November 2005 debt maturities. Other, net increased $6.7 million primarily as the result of higher interest income. Other Income (Deductions) in 2004 reduced income $405.1 million compared to a reduction of $460.5 million in 2003. Interest expense, net decreased $60.8 million from 2003 primarily due to lower long term interest rates and a decrease in total debt of $354 million from December 31, 2003. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $92.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004 primarily due to lower pre tax income from the prior year. Income taxes increased $6.5 million in 2004 over 2003 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income. The effective income tax rates were 34.5%, 35.9%, and 35.5 % in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contributing to the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 versus 2004 is the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction (discussed below), an adjustment to deferred taxes at Northern Indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors. Offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at Kokomo Gas and increased taxes related to Ohio income tax law changes enacted on June 30, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law on October 22, 2004, created new Internal Revenue Code Section 199 which, beginning in 2005, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Northern Indiana and Whiting Clean Energys electric production activities qualify for this deduction. The deduction is equal to 3% of QPAI for the taxable year, with certain limitations. This deduction increases to 6% of QPAI beginning in 2007 and 9% of QPAI beginning in 2010 and thereafter. The 2005 tax benefit associated with the Section 199 domestic production deduction is estimated to be $1.9 million and will be finalized prior to inclusion in NiSources 2005 consolidated federal income tax return to be filed in 2006. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected income of $23.2 million, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2005, $5.3 million, or $0.02 per basic share, in 2004 and a loss of $332.9 million, or loss of $1.28 per basic share, in 2003. Current years income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is due to a gain on discontinued operations of $43.5 million offset by a loss of $20.3 million. The gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of taxes, resulted from changes to reserves for contingencies related primarily to the previous sales of IWC, former Primary Energy subsidiaries and other dispositions. The loss from discontinued operations included changes to reserves for contingencies primarily related to CER and an impairment of assets related to Transcom. In 2004, income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is primarily from a reduction in estimated income taxes associated with NiSources former exploration and production subsidiary, CER. In 2003, an after tax loss of $301.2 million was related to the sale of CER, while a loss of $29.1 million was recognized on the sale of six PEI subsidiaries and a loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Transcom. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 of $0.3 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2003 of $8.8 million, net of taxes, resulted from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information regarding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric distribution businesses, is subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $712.3 million, a decrease of $343.6 million from a year ago. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of accounts receivable balances which were $267 million higher due mainly to the impact of higher gas prices, and the additional $114 million of cash required for deferred tax payments mostly due to the expiration in 2004 of bonus tax depreciation enacted under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Investing Activities On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. On August 29, 2003, NiSource sold its exploration and production subsidiary, CER, to a subsidiary of Triana for $330 million, plus Trianas assumption of obligations to deliver approximately 94.0 Bcf of natural gas pursuant to existing forward sales contracts. On January 28, 2003, NiSources former subsidiary, CNR, sold its interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York for approximately $95 million. NiSource has accounted for CER as discontinued operations and has adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During 2003, NiSource recognized an after tax loss of $301.2 million related to the sales. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities. The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and an estimate for year 2006: (in millions) 2006E 2005 2004 2003 Gas Distribution Operations $ 252.9 $ 278.5 $ 225.2 $ 195.1 Transmission and Storage Operations 230.7 167.9 133.3 120.5 Electric Operations 140.1 135.6 154.0 225.1 Other Operations 14.5 17.0 10.9 31.8 Total $ 638.2 $ 599.0 $ 523.4 $ 572.5 For 2005, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $599.0 million, an increase of $75.6 million over 2004. This increase was primarily due to construction of the Columbus Northern Loop Pipeline project at the Gas Distribution Operations segment and incremental pipeline expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in compliance with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital program in 2005 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric Operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding NOx reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Capital expenditures in the Other Operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprise wide information technology infrastructure improvement. For 2006, the projected capital program is expected to be $638.2 million, which is $39.2 million higher than the 2005 level. This higher spending is mainly due to an increase in expenditures for integrity management improvements in the pipeline segment and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation in addition to new business projects. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Financing Activities On July 29, 2003, NiSource filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to periodically sell up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities. The registration statement became effective on August 7, 2003, which when combined with NiSources pre existing shelf capacity, provided an aggregate $2.8 billion of total issuance capacity. As of December 31, 2005, NiSources shelf capacity is currently $850 million. Long term Debt. On November 29, 2005, Columbia redeemed $1.1 billion of its senior unsecured notes that became callable on November 28, 2005, having an average interest rate of 7.34%. On November 28, 2005, Columbia redeemed $281.5 million of its senior unsecured notes with an average interest rate of 6.80%. The associated charges included an $86 million non cash charge relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of a fair market value adjustment made at the time of the NiSource Columbia merger, an $8 million non cash charge associated with the unamortized portion of swap termination charges, and a $14 million cash charge for call premiums, all of which were charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt. On November 28, 2005, NiSource Finance issued, in the private placement market, $900 million in unregistered senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $315 million of 7 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.21%; $230 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.36%; $90 million of 11 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.41%; and $265 million of 20 year notes at a coupon rate of 5.89%. The proceeds, along with other funding sources, were used to refinance the above mentioned Columbia senior unsecured notes. On November 15, 2005, NiSource Finance redeemed $900 million of its senior unsecured notes having an average interest of 7.625%. On September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of 5.25% 12 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2017 and $550 million of 5.45% 15 year unsecured notes that mature September 15, 2020. The proceeds were used in part to redeem $900 million of NiSource Finance notes due November 15, 2005. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% and 5.45% notes, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. During July 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $34 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.62%. During June 2005, Northern Indiana redeemed $39.3 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes with an average interest rate of 6.79% and 6.58%, respectively. During April 2005, Capital Markets redeemed $30 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.67%. On November 23, 2004, NiSource Finance issued $450 million of five year floating rate unsecured notes that mature November 23, 2009. The notes are callable, at par, on or after November 23, 2006. Subsequently, on December 10, 2004, NiSource Finance used $250 million of the proceeds from the $450 million floating rate note offering to 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. redeem $250 million of existing floating rate notes that were due May 2005. The remaining proceeds were used to repay a portion of NiSource Finance short term borrowings. On November 1, 2004, NiSource issued approximately 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSources SAILSsm. NiSource received approximately $144.4 million in satisfaction of the SAILSsm holders obligation under the stock purchase contracts, which was used to pay down short term borrowings. Effective November 1, 2004, the interest rate on the $144.4 million of debentures that comprised the debt component of the SAILSsm was reset to 3.628% per annum. The debentures mature November 1, 2006. During July 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $32 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 6.53%. During April 2004, Capital Markets redeemed $80 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.39%. During February 2004, Northern Indiana redeemed $111.1 million of its medium term notes and Bay State redeemed $10 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.49% and 7.63%, respectively. The associated redemption premium was $4.5 million, of which $4.1 million was charged to loss on early extinguishment of long term debt and $0.4 million was recorded as a regulatory asset. Credit Facilities. On November 30, 2005, NiSource Finance entered into a new $300 million 9 month revolving credit agreement with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein LLC. The new facility will further improve NiSources available liquidity in the current environment of volatile natural gas prices. During March 2005, NiSource Finance obtained a new $1.25 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an expiring $500 million 364 day credit facility, as well as a $750 million three year credit facility that would have expired in March 2007. As of February 28, 2006, there were $717.5 million of borrowings under the existing facilities. NiSource had short term cash investments of $7.1 million as of that date. NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances of $898.0 million at December 31, 2005, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%, and advances of $307.6 million at December 31, 2004, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.04%. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NiSource had $101.6 million and $111.6 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2005, $72.7 million of the $101.6 million total outstanding letters of credit resided within a separate bi lateral letter of credit arrangement with Barclays Bank that NiSource obtained during February 2004. Of the remaining $28.9 million of stand by letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005, $25.5 million resided under NiSources five year credit facility and $3.4 million resided under an uncommitted arrangement with another financial institution. As of December 31, 2005, $626.5 million of credit was available under both credit facilities. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under both its five year revolving credit facility and its nine month revolving credit agreement. NiSource must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2005, NiSource was in compliance with this financial covenant in both of its credit agreements. NiSource is also subject to certain negative covenants under the revolving credit facilities. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket equal to 5% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets. The revolving credit facilities also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. NiSources bond indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources bond indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional asset basket capped at either 5% or 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. On May 14, 2004, Columbia of Ohio entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CORC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Ohio. CORC, in turn, is party to an agreement, also dated May 14, 2004, in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $300 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. The agreement has a scheduled expiration date of May 12, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, $175 million of accounts receivable had been sold by CORC. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio acts as administrative agent, by performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold by CORC. Columbia of Ohio receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. On December 30, 2003, Northern Indiana entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to NRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Indiana. NRC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit can purchase up to $200 million of accounts receivable under the agreement. NRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled expiration date of December 22, 2006, and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2005, NRC had sold $200 million of accounts receivable. Under the arrangement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Under the agreement, Northern Indiana acts as administrative agent, performing record keeping and cash collection functions for the accounts receivable sold. Northern Indiana receives a fee, which provides adequate compensation, for such services. Credit Ratings. NiSources credit ratings continue to be affirmed by the major rating agencies. Both Moodys Investors Services and Standard and Poors affirmed their ratings in December of 2005. Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries is stable. Standard and Poors affirmed its senior unsecured ratings of NiSource at BBB, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Standard and Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Fitch Ratings affirmed their BBB senior unsecured rating for NiSource and the BBB ratings for Columbia and Northern Indiana. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Certain TPC gas trading agreements contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard and Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other gas trading agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $170 million to $175 million. Columbia Energy Services is the principal for two surety bonds issued to guarantee performance in two separate long term gas supply agreements. The surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreements, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of letters of credit required with respect to this transaction was $72.7 million. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Columbia was the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia and had indemnity values, which 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. declined over time and had ratings triggers based on Columbias credit rating. In the third quarter of 2005, these bonds expired. In February 2006, the forward sales agreements guaranteed by Columbia were completed. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond 2006. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2005 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Long term debt $ 5,692.3 $ 438.0 $ 89.2 $ 33.4 $ 465.8 $ 1,015.2 $ 3,650.7 Capital leases 10.2 2.0 2.0 2.6 2.7 0.1 0.8 Operating leases 248.1 48.4 43.5 38.2 29.1 23.1 65.8 Purchase obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,137.1 222.7 204.9 173.8 113.0 100.7 322.0 IBM service obligations 1,484.4 142.1 164.3 165.2 165.1 167.3 680.4 Pure Air service obligations 107.9 15.2 15.8 16.3 16.8 17.2 26.6 Total contractual obligations $ 8,680.0 $ 868.4 $ 519.7 $ 429.5 $ 792.5 $ 1,323.6 $ 4,746.3 The long term debt amounts shown above represent payment of principal and do not include associated interest costs. For 2006, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $381 million, which includes $338 million of interest payments related to its long term debt. NiSource also has obligations associated with various taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $638 million in 2006. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2019, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. In June 2005, NiSource Corporate Services and IBM signed a definitive agreement to provide a broad range of business process and support services to NiSource. As part of this agreement, IBM will operate a broad range of business support functions for NiSource, including processes within the Human Resources, Finance and Accounting, Supply Chain (procurement), Customer Contact, Meter to Cash (billing and collections) and Information Technology areas. The agreement also includes a broad array of transformational consulting services and emerging technology expertise. The contract has a 10 year term and NiSource has the right to renew it for up to three additional years. NiSource will pay for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The variable charge component can fluctuate to reflect NiSources actual usage of service and service levels. Fees may be adjusted to reflect economic changes such as inflation or business changes that both parties agree to. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by IBM), NiSource must pay IBM a termination charge that will include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs un recovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee can be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Due to strong equity markets, the fair value of NiSources pension fund assets as of September 30, 2005, have increased for the third year in a row. Additionally, $9.1 million in employer contributions were made during 2005 to certain of NiSources qualified and non qualified pension plans. NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods and expects to contribute approximately $7.1 million in 2006 to certain pension plans. However, NiSource may provide additional funding for the pension plans. As a result of the increase in the fair value of the plan assets and certain changes to the pension plans and benefits provided, NiSource expects pension expense for 2006 to decrease approximately $15.7 million from the amount recognized in 2005. Also, NiSource expects to make contributions of $54.2 million to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2006. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. See Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2006. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2005, including commercial commitments for discontinued operations, and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Lines of credit $ 898.0 $ 898.0 $ $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 101.6 27.0 1.0 73.6 Guarantees 6,219.5 1,101.2 53.4 60.1 513.6 1,004.3 3,486.9 Total commercial commitments $ 7,219.1 $ 2,026.2 $ 54.4 $ 133.7 $ 513.6 $ 1,004.3 $ 3,486.9 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $5.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. As a result of the fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions referenced below, $1,160 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements, variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2005 and 2004, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $20.1 million and $20.5 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Between October 27, 2004 and November 1, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into $900 million of forward starting interest rate swaps, hedging the future interest payments of long term debt. The $900 million of forward starting swaps included $450 million notional value of 12 year forward starting swaps entered into with three counterparties and $450 million notional value of 15 year forward starting swaps entered into with three additional counterparties. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. During September 2005, NiSource Finance settled these forward starting swaps resulting in a $35.5 million payment to NiSources swap counterparties. The swap termination payments are being amortized over the life of the new debt issues, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on May 15, 2009 at mid market. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either July 15, 2008 or July 15, 2013 at mid market. On April 11, 2003, Columbia entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $100 million with two counterparties. Columbia received payments based upon a fixed 7.42% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 2.39% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated on May 12, 2004. On April 4, 2003, Columbia terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement in a notional amount of $100 million. Columbia received a settlement payment from the counterparty amounting to $8.2 million, which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, stand by letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analysis of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. As of December 31, 2005, all power trading contracts were settled. TPC may enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with operating Whiting Clean Energy, which may not qualify for hedge treatment as determined by SFAS No. 133. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the NYMEX, other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets, as well as financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations and the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2005 are: (in millions at December 31) 2005 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ (3.0 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (0.4 ) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (1.3 ) Other changes in fair values during the period 4.7 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance/covariance methodology. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, during 2005, respectively. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during 2005, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.5 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. The VaR limit for power trading was $2.5 million, however, this limit was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts. Should TPC enter into power derivative contracts in the future to manage price risk associated with Whiting Clean Energy, those contracts would be limited to the physical generation capacity of Whiting Clean Energy. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 S, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Off Balance Sheet Items NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $1.1 billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, NiSource has other guarantees, purchase commitments, operating leases, lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, and Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on June 15, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. In addition, NiSource has sold certain accounts receivable. NiSources accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in SFAS No. 140. In the agreements, all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership. NiSource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs. Refer to Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. SFAS No. 71, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,203.1 million and $1,386.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $998.4 million and $1,222.3 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 1 F, Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $49.8 million at December 31, 2005. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under SFAS No. 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $376.0 million and $209.4 million of price risk 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. management assets, of which $338.1 million and $200.0 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $94.5 million and $52.4 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $85.6 million and $26.7 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income, net of taxes, was $150.7 million and $93.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accounting for Energy Trading Activities. NiSource is not presently involved in energy trading activities. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including energy related contracts such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. In the October 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in SFAS No. 133 can be marked to market. Refer to Note 6, Risk Management and Energy Trading Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was zero and a loss of $3.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contained price risk management assets of zero and $8.8 million and price risk management liabilities of zero and $11.9 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 9, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 to clarify the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations and to provide additional guidance for when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. NiSource has adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 2005. Refer to Note 10, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions. This statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, as directed by the SEC in their April 15, 2005 amendment to Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into four primary business segments; Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, Electric Operations, and Other Operations. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. S X. NiSource will adopt this standard on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application as described in the statement. Under this method, NiSource will begin to amortize compensation costs for the remaining portion of the outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered. Compensation costs for these awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as disclosed on a pro forma basis under SFAS No. 123. NiSource will account for awards that are granted, modified or settled after December 31, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. NiSource does not anticipate ongoing operating results to be materially impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. NiSource expects to recognize an immaterial cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. NiSource anticipates that other than the requirement for expensing stock options, the current share based awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently. For 2006, NiSources Board has determined that it would not provide incumbent executives additional grants of options, restricted or contingent shares. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This proposal seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the proposal would require that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The proposal would require recognition in the financial statements of the best estimate of the effects of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities, based solely on the technical merits of the position. NiSource is currently reviewing the provisions of the Exposure Draft to determine the impact it may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The release of a final interpretation is scheduled for March or April of 2006, with an effective date of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Environmental Matters NiSource affiliates have retained environmental liability, including cleanup liability, associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations, petroleum operations, certain LDCs and CER. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment. The ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels, and methane, a component of natural gas. Certain NiSource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. NiSource is currently a participant in United States EPAs Climate Leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2005, NiSource had 7,822 employees of which 3,405 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire in various periods between 2006 and 2013. Northern Indianas agreement, which covers over half of the total bargaining unit employees, expires on May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, gas on gas competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Restructuring Gas Distribution Operations recorded restructuring charges of $22.6 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $18.3 million was an allocation from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Distribution Operations amounted to $3.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $8.9 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Regulatory Matters Gas Distribution Operations continues to offer CHOICE opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. As of December 2005, approximately 668 thousand of Gas Distribution Operations residential, small commercial and industrial customers were using an alternate supplier. On March 29, 2005, the PSC approved a renewed pilot program for Columbia of Kentucky authorizing the continuation of the Customer Choicesm Program. The renewed program provides residential and small commercial customers the option to choose their natural gas supplier while avoiding the stranded costs to Columbia of Kentucky that would have resulted under the previous pilot. In addition, Columbia of Kentucky received approval from the PSC to implement programs that provide Columbia of Kentucky with the opportunity to stabilize wholesale costs for gas during the winter heating season and share certain cost savings with customers. On December 17, 2003, the PUCO approved an application by Columbia of Ohio and other Ohio LDCs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable. On October 1, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed an application for approval to increase its Uncollectible Expense Rider and on October 20, 2004, the PUCO approved the application. The PUCOs approval of this application resulted in Columbia of Ohios commencing recovery of the deferred uncollectible accounts receivables and establishment of future bad debt recovery requirements in November 2004. As of December 31, 2005, Columbia of Ohio has $37.7 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On June 1, 2005, the PUCO approved Columbia of Ohios application to decrease its Uncollectible Expense Rider rate. This application was based on projected annual bad debt recovery requirements of $26.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2006, reflecting a reduction of $11.4 million of uncollected accounts receivable pending future recovery. On December 2, 2004, Columbia of Ohio filed two applications with the OPSB, requesting certificates of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. The project is proposed in three phases (Phases IV, V and VI), and contemplates an approximately 25 mile long pipeline, to be constructed in northern Columbus and southern Delaware County. The project will help secure current and future natural gas supplies for Columbia of Ohios customers in the region. On August 3, 2005, the OPSB approved Columbia of Ohios construction of the Northern Columbus Loop Natural Gas Pipeline project. Phase V of the project has been completed and the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2006. On November 21, 2005, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with the PUCO, requesting authority to increase its PIP rider rate from $.0821/Mcf to $.6449/Mcf. This filing provided for the recovery of Columbia of Ohios deferred PIP balance over a twelve month period plus the expected level of arrears during each succeeding twelve month period. On December 23, 2005, Columbia of Ohio supplemented its application, and as an alternative offered to 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued) extend the recovery period for its deferred balance over 36 months, with carrying costs. This filing provided, in the alternative, for the implementation of a revised PIP rate of $.4004/Mcf. Columbia of Ohios Supplement to its Application indicated that the PIP rate contained in its November 21, 2005 application would be billed absent express PUCO approval of the alternative within the 45 day review process. The PUCO took no action within the forty five day period, and on January 9, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs to reflect the new $.6449/Mcf PIP rider rate, effective with February 2006 bills. On February 1, 2006, the PUCO issued an Entry in which it indicated that it had approved Columbia of Ohios application (as supplemented) on the 46th day after the filing (January 6, 2006). On February 28, 2006, Columbia of Ohio filed revised tariffs, reflecting the lower PIP rider rate of $.4004 /Mcf, to be effective with bills rendered on and after March 2, 2006. On April 27, 2005, Bay State filed for a rate increase of $22.2 million, or 4.7%, with the Massachusetts DTE. On November 30, 2005, Bay State received approval from the Massachusetts DTE to increase its rates by $11.1 million. The Massachusetts DTE also approved Bay States request for a performance based rate plan but denied the request for cost recovery of a steel infrastructure replacement program. On November 2, 2005, Columbia of Virginia filed an Application with the VSCC for approval of a performance based rate making methodology (PBR Plan), which would freeze non gas cost rates at their current levels for five years beginning January 1, 2006. The VSCC issued a Preliminary Order on November 9, 2005 that docketed the PBR Plan and simultaneously initiated an investigation (Investigation) into the justness and reasonableness of Columbia of Virginias current rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The Preliminary Order initially required Columbia of Virginia to file the schedules typically required for a general rate case application on or before February 3, 2006. By Order dated January 4, 2006, the VSCC granted a Columbia of Virginia Motion to delay the filing of schedules in the Investigation until May 1, 2006. Northern Indianas gas costs are recovered under a flexible GCA mechanism approved by the IURC in 1999. Under the approved procedure, a demand component of the fuel adjustment factor is determined annually effective November 1 of each year, after hearings and IURC approval. The commodity component of the adjustment factor is determined by monthly filings, which do not require IURC approval but are reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that takes place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas GCA factor also includes a GCIM which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indianas GCA6 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005 was made on August 26, 2004. The IURC issued their final Order on August 24, 2005 permitting Northern Indiana full recovery of its gas costs and affirming its position on the regulatory pricing of gas in storage as decided in Northern Indianas GCA5. Northern Indianas GCA7 annual demand cost recovery filing, covering the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2006 was made on August 29, 2005. The IURC approved the rates on an interim basis subject to refund on November 22, 2005. A final order approving this filing is expected in the second quarter of 2006. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indiana and other parties filed a joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the IURC resolving all terms of a new gas ARP program. The IURC approved the Settlement on January 31, 2006. The new ARP is effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2010. The new ARP continues key products and services including Northern Indianas Choice program for customers. The ARP also continues the GCIM and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers. Northern Indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement. Northern Indiana filed for an energy assistance program Winter Warmth in the fourth quarter of 2004, that provided customers $6.2 million for deposits and bill assistance targeted to low income and hardship customers. Northern Indiana contributed $0.7 million, and $5.5 million was collected from ratepayers through a volumetric 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) surcharge. The one year pilot program, for calendar year 2005, was approved by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2004. Northern Indiana filed, on October 3, 2005, to extend the Winter Warmth program to cover calendar year 2006 and expand funding to $7.9 million. The IURC issued an interim order on December 9, 2005 extending the 2005 program through January 31, 2006. On January 31, 2006, the IURC issued a final order approving the expanded program for the period February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The total funding for 2006 will be $7.8 million, based upon the final order. Northern Indiana will contribute $1.0 million of the total funding. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Market Conditions Spot prices for the winter of 2004 2005 were primarily in the range of $6.00 $8.00/Dth. This was a significant increase from the prices experienced during the winter of 2003 2004 that were in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range. Entering the 2004 2005 winter season, storage levels were at an all time high since the Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data with a level of 3,293 Bcf. Slightly warmer than normal weather for the 2004 2005 winter season left national storage levels at 1,249 Bcf, well above the prior five year average of 1,022 Bcf. During the summer of 2005, prices ranged primarily between $6.00 and $15.00/Dth, with the months of September and October 2005 showing dramatic price increases over the summer months due to the devastating hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused severe damage to production platforms, processing facilities and the Gulf Coast pipeline system. However, gas storage reached 3,168 Bcf entering the winter heating season, slightly above the prior five year average. Through December 2005, the winter of 2005 2006 price levels were primarily between $9.00 and $15.00/Dth, while price levels in January and February 2006 were primarily between $8.00 and $10.00/Dth. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to be included in future customer billings. During times of unusually high gas prices, throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory, the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under Regulatory Matters. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 59 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Distribution Operations segments net capital expenditure program was $278.5 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $252.9 million in 2006. This reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected reduction in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately $96 million in 2005 and are expected to be approximately the same for 2006. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2% colder than normal and 3% colder than 2004, increasing net revenues by approximately $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than 2003, decreasing net revenues by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 864.0 MMDth, compared to 897.8 MMDth for 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower off system and transportation sales resulting from fewer customers in these categories, partially offset by higher residential sales resulting from cooler weather and an increase in customers. Residential customers increased in part as a result of fewer customers participating in a CHOICE program, where they would purchase gas from a third party supplier. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 897.8 MMDth, compared to 876.2 MMDth for 2003. This increase was primarily due to higher off system, industrial, and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2005 were $1,504.9 million, an increase of $64.3 million from 2004. Net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to $32.3 million. Net revenues also increased $26.2 million as a result of regulatory trackers and $16.0 million from a gross receipts tax tracker, which are both offset in operating expenses, as well as $12.1 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately $33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused largely by higher gas prices experienced in 2005. Net revenues for 2004 were $1,440.6 million, down $36.0 million from 2003, mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 amounting to approximately $33 million. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs, reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to $23.4 million, and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of $9.7 million. These reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately $8.5 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of $25.8 million from the stipulation agreement granted for Columbia of Ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to Bay State. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $368.2 million, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $95.1 million, net of $42.2 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues, which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above. Operating income decreased as a result of transition costs, restructuring charges, including a pension and postretirement benefit charge, and new system development costs associated with the IBM agreement totaling $49.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of $30.0 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for Columbia of Ohio, a $10.9 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the NiSource acquisition of Kokomo Gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of $7.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $441.2 million, a decrease of $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2003. The decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above, and higher operating expenses of $29.2 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of $6.7 million and depreciation expense of $4.4 million. In addition, the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and reserve changes of approximately $14.2 million. Both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

The project is currently being marketed in two phases. Phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with Empire, an existing pipeline that originates at the Canadian border and extends easterly towards Syracuse, New York. Empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with Millennium near Corning, New York. Millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with Algonquin Gas Transmission at Ramapo, New York. As currently planned, Phase 2 would cross the Hudson River, linking to the New York City metropolitan market. The FERC issued an order in September 2002 in which it granted final certificate authority for the original Millennium project, but specified that Millennium could not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions were met. One such condition, impacting what is now being marketed as Phase 2 of the project, was compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the NYDOS. NYDOS determined that the Hudson River crossing plan was not consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Millenniums appeal of that decision to the United States Department of Commerce was denied. Millennium filed an appeal of the United States Department of Commerce ruling relating to the projects Hudson River crossing plan in the United States Federal District Court on February 13, 2004, where the appeal is still pending. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) On August 1, 2005, Millennium submitted a certificate amendment filing to the FERC. This amended filing requests authorization from the FERC to construct the project in phases, details construction and development plans for Phase 1 of the project, and includes executed precedent agreements for service on Phase 1 of the project. Millennium recently completed renegotiations of the precedent agreements with its anchor shippers. The reconfigured Millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by Empire, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Islander East collectively referred to as the Companion Pipelines. The timing of receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals for Millennium and its Companion Pipelines may impact the targeted in service date of the fourth quarter of 2007 and may even affect the viability of Phase 1. Provided the necessary approvals are received in a timely manner, Millennium plans to begin construction in Spring 2007. The current Millennium partnership includes Columbia Transmission (47.5%), DTE Millennium (owned by DTE Energy Co.) (10.5%), KeySpan Millennium (owned by KeySpan Corp.) (21.0%), and Columbia Atlantic Trading (21.0%), and Columbia Transmission will be the operator. At the time Columbia purchased the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest in 2004, it was with the intent to redistribute that interest to either a future customer of Millennium or the other partners. In late 2004, the other partners expressed an interest in purchasing the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest and an MOU was completed on August 22, 2005, which set forth the equity redistribution from Columbia Atlantic Trading to DTE and KeySpan. After completion of this transaction, Columbias ownership will be at 47.5% and the ownership interests of KeySpan and DTE will be 26.25% each. Along with the equity redistribution effort, the partnership is also in the process of re writing the partnership agreements. However, under the existing partnership agreements all material decisions require approval by a supermajority of the partners which is currently defined as being at least three of the four partners. Subsequent to execution of the August 22, 2005 MOU, Columbia, KeySpan and DTE have performed a comprehensive due diligence review. Certain findings through this process identified the need to continue to negotiate the terms for the redistribution of the Columbia Atlantic Trading interest to find a mutually satisfactory outcome for all partners. A revised term sheet was tentatively agreed upon in January 2006 and is being utilized as a base upon which to finalize all pertinent agreements. All agreements are currently in final draft form. The equity redistribution and the re writing of the partnership agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Although Columbia has a temporary ownership interest in excess of 50%, it does not exert control over the partnership. Columbia is unable to move forward with the project without agreement from the other partners due to economic, contractual and regulatory constraints per the partnership agreements. All major decisions, such as selection of Millenniums key employees, selection of the construction contractor, budget approvals and major construction planning decisions are all subject to supermajority approval of the partners, which under the current agreements requires the vote of at least three of the four partners. Recently, a key commercial date passed, December 31, 2005, whereby in order to continue the project development efforts, Millennium was required to formalize its management approval process to satisfy certain conditions in certain customer agreements. This approval had to have the unanimous agreement of all partners. These rights are considered substantive participating rights as discussed in EITF 96 16. Decisions by the sponsors regarding additional aspects of the project may impair Millenniums ability to recover in rates certain development costs it has previously incurred. Hardy Storage Project In November 2004, Columbia Transmission and a subsidiary of Piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern United States. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont have formed Hardy Storage, to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in West Virginia. Columbia Transmission and Piedmont each have a 50% equity interest in the project, and Columbia Transmission will serve as operator of the facilities. An open season for Hardy Storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the projects storage capacity under long term firm contracts. The field, which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 Bcf of natural gas, is planned to begin service in November 2007, and will ultimately be able to deliver 176 MMDth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the four customers subscribing to capacity in Hardy Storage. These customers have also signed long term firm agreements with Columbia Transmission for transportation capacity to 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) deliver gas from Hardy Storage to their markets. Columbia Transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity. Both Hardy Storage and Columbia Transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the FERC on April 25, 2005, and received a favorable order on November 1, 2005. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2006. Service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007. Other Growth Projects Columbia Transmission recently held open seasons for two additional projects, the central and southern Virginia expansion and the Eastern Market expansion. Market interest for both projects was encouraging and Columbia Transmission has signed precedent agreements with four East Coast customers for the Eastern Market expansion. Customer negotiations are ongoing for the central and southern Virginia expansion. Columbia Transmission currently anticipates filing appropriate regulatory applications during 2006. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of FERC Order No. 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs. On October 31, 2004, firm contracts expired for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, which represented approximately 60% of the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Based upon new commitments, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations realized a reduction of approximately $34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement contracts. The terms of the replacement contracts entered into by Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf range from one year to 15 years, with an average term of approximately seven years. These reductions were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately $14 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts. Regulatory Matters On June 30, 2005, the FERC issued the Order On Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs. This guidance was issued by the FERC to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. The effective date of the guidance is January 1, 2006 after which all assessment costs will be recorded as operating expenses. Importantly, the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to January 1, 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded. There is no material impact on 2005 for this order, but it is anticipated that operating expenses will increase approximately $7 $12 million in future years related to this guidance and the expenditures NiSource expects to incur to comply with the DOTs Integrity Management Rule. On March 31, 2005, the FERC issued an order regarding Columbia Transmissions annual EPCA filing. The FERCs order accepted the filing, subject to refund, and established a hearing to address issues related to the appropriate methodology for allocating costs associated with the new electric Downingtown Compressor units. An uncontested settlement was reached among the parties and was filed with FERC on August 31, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the FERC approved the settlement without modifications or conditions. The settlement will not have a material financial impact on the company. On March 29, 2005, the FERC issued an unconditional order accepting Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2005 RAM filing. Columbia Transmissions March 1, 2004 RAM is still pending before the FERC, with no statutory time requirement for future action; however, with the approval of the 2005 RAM filing, management does not anticipate a material adverse order. Restructuring Gas Transmission and Storage Operations recorded restructuring charges of $6.5 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations amounted to $2.4 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability remaining at December 31, 2005, was $3.4 million. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006.

Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segments capital expenditure program was $167.9 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $230.7 million in 2006. The increase is due to a large pipeline replacement project as well as for the Millennium and Hardy Storage projects and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations new business initiatives. The large pipeline project is to replace approximately 35 miles of line 1278, which is located in the state of Pennsylvania. New business initiatives totaled approximately $21.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $65.8 million in 2006. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services for gas delivered south of Leach, Kentucky. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State Gas provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.1 MMDth for 2005, compared to 1,172.7 MMDth in 2004. Decreases in offshore natural gas production in the Gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by Columbia Transmission. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,172.7 MMDth for 2004, compared to 1,238.9 MMDth in 2003. The decrease of 66.2 MMDth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003, the continued decline of offshore natural gas production, and other non weather factors. Net Revenues Net revenues were $810.7 million for 2005, a decrease of $21.9 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers, which amounted to approximately $34 million for the year. Additionally, revenue from regulatory trackers decreased $7.4 million, which is offset in operating expenses. These reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately $14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by a $8.9 million third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shippers long term contract. Net revenues were $832.6 million for 2004, a decrease of $4.7 million from 2003. The decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of $5.8 million. This resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf on October 31, 2004, which represented approximately 60% of Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net annual revenues. Operating Income Operating income of $344.4 million in 2005 decreased $18.7 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above. Operating expenses, excluding savings of $7.4 million of tracker expense offset in revenue, increased $4.2 million as a result of restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with the IBM agreement that totaled $12.8 million. These increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by a reduction in pension expense. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating income of $363.1 million in 2004 decreased $35.7 million from 2003. While net revenue decreased $4.7 million, as discussed above, operating expenses increased $31.0 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an $11.0 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures, a $6.6 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003, a $3.0 million reduction of a franchise tax reserve and a $2.3 million gain on the sale of certain assets. For the year 2004, pension expense increased by $5.7 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.8 million as compared to the 2003 period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Notwithstanding those changes, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) The U.S. Steel Industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, increased energy costs, and fluctuating demand for their products. The industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place. Increased use of advanced technology by U.S. steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity, reducing the labor differential between international producers and those in the United States. Steel demand for 2006 is anticipated to remain at current levels for the first half of the year. It is estimated that international pressure may reduce the price per ton for rolled steel by as much as 20% by June 2006. This anticipated price reduction may cause inventories to increase once again and repeat the price/production cycle seen in 2004 and 2005. Electric sales to the steel industry in 2005 were down 3.2% as compared to 2004. In 2005, Northern Indiana coal deliveries from the PRB area were limited to 80 85% of contracted amounts as a result of maintenance problems on track owned jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company. Northern Indiana met the expected electricity demand through the end of 2005 by changing the fuel blend, which reduced its need for PRB coal. Northern Indiana has been blending this fuel for a number of years. In the second quarter of 2006, track maintenance will resume until completion, but at this time it is unknown if coal deliveries will be impacted. Restructuring Electric Operations recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2005 in connection with a NiSource outsourcing agreement with IBM, of which $4.0 million was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Payments made for all restructuring initiatives within Electric Operations amounted to $0.1 million during 2005 and the restructuring liability at December 31, 2005, was zero. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Electric Operations segment. Regulatory Matters During 2002, Northern Indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive bill credits of approximately $55.1 million each year, for a cumulative total of $225 million, for the minimum 49 month period, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order provides a rate moratorium through July 31, 2006. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by Northern Indiana. The revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the $55.1 million target. Credits amounting to $58.5 million, $56.4 million and $52.0 million were recognized for electric customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, a final rule addressing the formation and operation of Regional Transmission Organizations. The rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service. Northern Indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO on October 1, 2003. Transmission service for Northern Indiana occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff, as the Northern Indiana Open Access Transmission Tariff was retired. The MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC, to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Under Day 1, the MISO provides transmission service as described above. Under Day 2 the MISO dispatches wholesale electricity and transmission service throughout much of the Midwest territory. Its responsibilities include managing the energy markets, managing transmission constraints, and managing the day ahead, real time and financial transmission rights markets. As part of Northern Indianas use of the MISOs transmission service, Day 1, Northern Indiana incurs transmission charges, based upon the FERC approved tariff, as well as administrative fees, which relate to the MISOs management and operations of the transmission system. Day 1 transmission charges are recovered through the FAC process. During 2004, an IURC order denied recovery or deferral of Day 1 administrative fees during Northern Indianas rate moratorium. Day 2 charges consist of fuel related and non fuel related categories. On June 1, 2005, the IURC issued an order authorizing Northern Indiana to recover fuel related Day 2 costs. The order denied 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) recovery or deferral of non fuel Day 2 costs during Northern Indianas rate moratorium, which expires July 31, 2006. The June 2005 order was unclear as to the categorization of certain types of MISO charges as to whether they were fuel or non fuel. These particular charges, which amounted to $8.7 million in 2005, were included as recoverable in Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but, pending a clarifying order from the IURC, Northern Indiana has provided a reserve for the full amount. In January 2006, the IURC approved Northern Indianas FAC 69 filing, but noted that this particular category of charges was approved subject to refund and subject to the final order. On February 17, 2006, a settlement agreement was filed in cause 42962 providing for recovery through the FAC process of these charges, subject to an agreed upon standard of reasonableness of the charges. The settling parties are Northern Indiana, Indianapolis Power Light, Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. and the OUCC. The Day 2 non fuel category includes $5.4 million in costs recorded as non recoverable in net revenues. Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Day 1 and Day 2 administrative fees, which were recorded as non recoverable operating expenses, totaled $5.1 million for 2005. Northern Indiana is authorized to begin the deferral of all non fuel and administrative MISO charges incurred after July 31, 2006 for consideration in a future rate proceeding. As part of the established settlements process with market participants, MISO uses resettlement statements to make adjustments related to prior operating periods. Amounts related to these adjustments cannot be anticipated or estimated in advance. Northern Indiana records these amounts when billed. In January 2002, Northern Indiana indefinitely shut down its Mitchell Station. In February 2004, the City of Gary announced an interest in acquiring the land on which the Mitchell Station is located for economic development, including a proposal to increase the length of the runways at the Gary International Airport. On May 7, 2004, the City of Gary filed a petition with the IURC seeking to have the IURC establish a value for the Mitchell Station and establish the terms and conditions under which the City of Gary would acquire the Mitchell Station. On January 18, 2006, the IURC issued a final order dismissing, without prejudice, this cause and the related settlement agreement finding that the agreement entered into between the City of Gary and Northern Indiana lacks essential terms necessary for it to be a valid and enforceable contract under Indiana law. Northern Indiana is evaluating the appropriate course of action for the Mitchell facility in light of the City of Garys need for that property and the substantial costs associated with restarting the facility. On May 25, 2004, Northern Indiana filed a petition for approval of a Purchased Power and Transmission Tracker Mechanism to recover the cost of purchased power to meet Northern Indianas retail electric load requirements and charges imposed on Northern Indiana by MISO. A hearing in this matter was held in December, 2004. Northern Indiana will withdraw this petition if the final order from the IURC in cause 42824 approves recovery of intermediate dispatchable power costs incurred in August to December 2005 as described below. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Northern Indiana, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, reached a settlement agreement on August 19, 2005 for purposes of partially settling cause 42824 (described above). The OUCC and the Industrial Group agreed to support Northern Indianas recovery of intermediate dispatchable power, through its FAC for the period August 9, 2005 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) through November 30, 2005. Additional settlement provisions include Northern Indianas agreement to file an electric base rate case on or before July 1, 2008. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the FAC. The FAC provides for costs to be collected if they are below a negotiated cap. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed testimony and exhibits establishing a new basis for the cap. Northern Indiana received approval from the IURC of its request on July 20, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 68 on August 15, 2005. This filing included a projected amount of intermediate dispatchable power costs for October to December 2005, consistent with the Interim Order in 42824. The IURC approved this filing on October 26, 2005. Northern Indiana filed FAC 69 on November 3, 2005. This filing included a reconciliation of actual intermediate dispatchable power purchases for August and September 2005. The filing also included recovery of certain MISO charges that Northern Indiana believes to be fuel related. The order approving the FAC 69 factor was issued January 11, 2006. The intermediate dispatchable power cost recovery is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42824 (described above). The recovery of certain MISO charges, considered by Northern Indiana to be fuel related, is subject to refund based upon the outcome of cause 42962 (described above). On November 26, 2002, Northern Indiana received approval for an ECT. Under the ECT, Northern Indiana is permitted to recover (1) AFUDC and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement IDEMs NOx State Implementation Plan through an ECRM and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an EERM. Under the IURCs November 26, 2002 order, Northern Indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semi annual basis for the ECRM and on an annual basis for the EERM. On December 21, 2005, the IURC approved Northern Indianas latest compliance plan with the estimate of $306 million. The ECRM revenues amounted to $27.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, and $51.7 million from inception to date, while EERM revenues were $7.6 million for 2005 and $8.8 million from inception to date. On February 4, 2005, Northern Indiana filed ECR 5 simultaneously with EER 2 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $235.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $10.5 million through December 31, 2004. The IURC approved ECR 5 and EER 2 on March 23, 2005. ECR 6 was filed in August 2005 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation) of $232.7 million and was approved by the IURC on October 26, 2005, with slight modifications. On February 3, 2006, Northern Indiana filed ECR 7 simultaneously with EER 3 for capital expenditures (net of accumulated depreciation for those components which have been placed in service) of $230.6 million and depreciation and operating expenses of $18.3 million through December 31, 2005. On April 13, 2005, Northern Indiana received an order from the IURC in a complaint filed by Jupiter. The complaint asserted that Northern Indianas service quality was not reasonably adequate. While concluding that Northern Indianas service was reasonably adequate, the IURC ruled that Northern Indiana must construct a backup line and pay Jupiter $2.5 million to install special fast switching equipment at the Jupiter plant. Further, Northern Indiana is precluded from recovering the $2.5 million in rates. Northern Indiana and Jupiter both have appealed the IURCs order in this matter to the Indiana Court of Appeals. These appeals are currently pending. On June 15, 2005, Northern Indiana filed a Motion to Stay with the Indiana Court of Appeals requesting a stay of the portions of the order that require Northern Indiana to pay $2.5 million to Jupiter and install a backup line to serve Jupiter. On July 13, 2005, Northern Indianas Motion to Stay the IURCs April 13, 2005 ruling was denied. Northern Indiana remitted the payment of $2.5 million to Jupiter in July 2005, and is working with Jupiter to incorporate the IURC required backup line and the special fast switching equipment with growth plans recently announced by Jupiter. On December 21, 2005, Jupiter filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a verified motion for remand asking that the case be moved to the IURC for further proceedings and for a temporary stay of the appeal during the remand. The purpose for the remand would be to permit the IURC to address the sufficiency of the remedy provided for in the order under review. On January 10, 2006, Northern Indiana filed with the Indiana Court of Appeals a response in opposition to the verified motion for remand filed by Jupiter. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income. Sale of PEI Assets On October 20, 2003, NiSource sold all of the steel related, inside the fence assets of its subsidiary, PEI, to Private Power. The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

In March 2005, Lake Erie Land, wholly owned by NiSource, recognized a pre tax impairment charge of $2.9 million related to the Sand Creek Golf Club property and began accounting for the operations of the golf club as discontinued operations. The assets of the Sand Creek Golf Club, valued at $12.0 million at December 31, 2005, are reported as assets of discontinued operations. An additional $5.6 million of assets, representing an estimate of land to be sold during the next twelve months, are reflected as assets held for sale. Sale of SunPower Corporation In November 2004, NiSource sold its interest in SunPower Corporation for the purchasers common shares valued at approximately $5.2 million at the time of sale. In the fourth quarter, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $3.4 million and an after tax gain of $2.0 million related to this sale. Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP. On November 26, 2003, NiSource sold its interest in Midtex Gas Storage Company, LLP for approximately $15.8 million and the assumption, by the buyer, of $1.7 million in debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized a pre tax gain of $7.5 million and an after tax gain of $4.4 million related to this sale which is included in Impairment and loss (gain) on sale of assets on the Statements of Consolidated Income.

The sale included six PEI operating subsidiaries and the name Primary Energy. Private Power paid approximately $325.4 million, comprised of $113.1 million in cash and the assumption of debt related liabilities and other obligations. The assumption of such liabilities and the after tax cash proceeds from the sale reduced NiSources debt by $273.6 million, of which $67.3 million was off balance sheet. NiSource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy. PEIs Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002. Initially, the facility was not able to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy reached an agreement in October 2004 with the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, under which the contractor paid for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses. Whiting Clean Energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs. For 2005, the PEI holding companies consolidated after tax loss was approximately $22.6 million. The profitability of the Whiting Clean Energy project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, approval of the electric sales agreement discussed in the following paragraph, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Also impacting the profitability of Whiting Clean Energy is the steam requirements for BPs oil refinery. During the first quarter of 2005, Whiting Clean Energy completed renegotiation 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BPs oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BPs need for steam, while reducing the power plants required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energys generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte Countys Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURCs Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006. Restructuring Other Operations recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million in 2005, which was allocated from NiSource Corporate Services. Refer to Note 5, Restructuring Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the Other Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $43.4 million, an increase of $20.4 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. For the year ended 2004, net operating revenues were $23.0 million, an increase of $10.9 million from 2003. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to a $5.1 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of $2.5 million. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.2 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.9 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $30.9 million in 2004 compared to an operating loss of $41.9 million in the 2003 period. This improvement is the result of the increase in net revenues mentioned above and lower employee and administrative expenses. An equity investment in SunPower Corporation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a gain of $3.4 million. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2005, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 17 F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The Electric Operations segments capital expenditure program was $135.6 million in 2005 and is projected to be approximately $140.1 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher expenditures for maintenance programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation. Expenditures for the NOx reduction program were approximately $8 million in 2005, and are budgeted to be approximately $4 million for 2006. Capital expenditures for customer growth were approximately $31 million in 2005 and are budgeted to be approximately $27 million for 2006. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.0 gwh for the year 2005, a slight increase of 119.5 gwh compared to 2004. The increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather, increases in non weather related usage and a 1% increase in customer count. This increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales. Electric Operations sales were 17,367.5 gwh for the year 2004, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh compared to 2003. The decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by increased non weather related usage and customer count. Although cooling degree days were up slightly in 2004 over 2003, the increases occurred in May and June, while the cooling degree days were down in the months of July and August, which are the months when the effect of cooling degree days on usage is greater. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $795.1 million for 2005, an increase of $34.9 million from 2004, primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by $26.8 million compared to the 2004 period, and increased non weather related usage and customer count totaling $24.1 million. Net revenues from environmental trackers also increased $15.3 million, of which $6.4 million is offset in operating expenses. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with MISO Day 2 costs totaling $15.7 million, $6.6 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of $5.3 million related to the purchase of power from Whiting Clean Energy. Electric Operations net revenues were $760.2 million for 2004, an increase of $31.6 million from 2003, primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to $14.7 million, of which $1.2 million is offset in expense, increased non weather related usage and customer count of $17.1 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of $12.4 million. The above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately $6 million. Operating Income Operating income for 2005 was $293.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million from 2004. The decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of $44.7 million, net of $6.4 million in expenses associated with the operation of NOx equipment, which are fully offset in net revenues. The operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges, including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge, and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the IBM service agreement which totaled $8.4 million, increased electric generating expense of $7.2 million and incremental MISO administrative expenses of $3.5 million. The increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a $25.1 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased approximately $8 million, of which $4.9 million was due to the operation of NOx equipment that is fully offset in revenue. Operating income for 2004 was $309.5 million, an increase of $42.0 million from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of the above mentioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of $27.1 million, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $15.3 million. Other taxes decreased due mainly to a $25.1 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) million reduction in estimated property tax accruals. Operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental MISO administrative expenses of $4.6 million, higher employee and administrative expenses of $3.8 million and higher outside services expense of $1.6 million. In addition, a $3.8 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the year over year increase in operating expenses. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
