Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSources plans, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, growth opportunities for NiSources businesses, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, actual operating experience of NiSources assets, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, the impact of potential new environmental laws or regulations, the results of material litigation, changes in pension funding requirements, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, and the matters set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW Executive Summary NiSource is an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas in the high demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Indiana. NiSource generates virtually 100% of its operating income through these rate regulated businesses. A significant portion of NiSources operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues from gas sales are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months. 24 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share for the same period in 2009. Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items: Electric Operations net revenues increased $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased $18.5 million primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues from growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million. The effective tax rate decreased to 32.4% compared to 41.8% for the comparable period last year. The decrease is due to NiSource recording a $15.2 million reduction in income tax expense in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of a rate case settlement by Columbia of Pennsylvania that requires the company to flow through certain tax benefits to customers in current rates. Additionally, the company experienced increases in income tax expense in 2009 for additional deferred income tax expense related to state apportionment changes. Increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following item: On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance finalized a cash tender offer for $273.1 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due in 2016. As a result of this tender offer, NiSource incurred $96.7 million in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, which is recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt. These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSources four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth continue to comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and expense management. Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters. NiSource is moving forward with regulatory initiatives across several gas distribution company markets, at Northern Indiana, and at Columbia Gulf. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches, NiSources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on long term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure. On November 19, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges. The filing requests an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross revenue of $75.7 million when compared to a normalized test year ended June 30, 2010. This is calculated to provide the opportunity to earn a return of 7.70% on net original cost rate base of $2,706 million. If approved, the rates from this new petition would replace any other existing rates, including those that may be approved by effect of the August 25, 2010 rate order for the 2008 rate case. The proposed rates would ease bill impacts on residential customers, while still allowing Northern Indiana 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. to continue investing in service, reliability and infrastructure improvements. Northern Indiana filed the proceeding under the IURCs minimum standard filing requirements prescribing timeframes for issuance of an order if required information is supplied as part of the rate case filing. The IURC held its prehearing conference on December 17, 2010 and issued a prehearing conference order on January 5, 2011. The parties agreed to and the IURC ordered a procedural schedule that includes a bifurcated hearing. The evidentiary hearing on Northern Indianas case in chief is scheduled for the week of February 28, 2011, and the evidentiary hearing for the remainder of the case is scheduled for the weeks of July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2011. The case is scheduled to be fully briefed by September 30, 2011 and an Order is anticipated by the end of 2011 with the implementation of new rates anticipated in the first quarter of 2012. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually, and seeking to implement a levelized distribution charge for its residential class that would mitigate revenue volatility associated with volumetric rates and provide residential customers with clear price signals. Columbia of Pennsylvania expects that the Pennsylvania PUC will issue an order in the third or fourth quarter of 2011 with rates going into effect in the fourth quarter. On May 3, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a natural gas rate case with the IURC. Northern Indiana entered into a comprehensive settlement with all parties on August 24, 2010. The Settlement Agreement was approved in entirety by Order issued on November 4, 2010 and new rates were placed into effect November 5, 2010. The order resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $14.9 million when compared to a normalized test year ended December 31, 2009. The IURC authorized Northern Indiana to increase the monthly fixed charge for residential customers from $6.36 to $11.00. The IURC also approved revised depreciation accrual rates for gas plant and authorized Northern Indiana to reduce current period gas plant depreciation expense by up to $25.7 million annually for the next four years or until further order of the IURC, whichever occurs first. On May 3, 2010, Columbia of Virginia filed a base rate case with the VSCC seeking an annual revenue increase of $13.0 million to recover an updated level of costs upon the expiration of its Performance Based Regulation Plan on December 31, 2010. Columbia of Virginia also sought a Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA), cost recovery of certain gas related items through its Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism rather than base rates, and forward looking adjustments predicted to occur during the rate year ending December 31, 2011. On November 16, 2010, Columbia of Virginia, the VSCC Staff and the other parties filed a Proposed Stipulation and Recommendation (Stipulation) that would result in an annual revenue increase of $4.9 million, including authorization of the WNA and recovery of certain gas related items through the PGA mechanism. The Chief Hearing Examiner issued a Report on December 2, 2010 recommending approval of the Stipulation. The VSCC issued a Final Order on December 17, 2010 adopting the Stipulation. New rates became effective January 1, 2011. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC. On June 25, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania and the other active parties filed a Joint Petition for Settlement that would result in an annual revenue increase of $12.0 million. On August 18, 2010, the Pennsylvania PUC entered a final order approving the Joint Petition for Settlement and new rates went into effect on October 1, 2010. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking a revenue increase of $2.2 million annually in order for Columbia of Maryland to earn the rate of return authorized by the PSC in its 2008 rate case. On May 10, 2010, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $1.7 million. The Maryland PSC issued a final order approving the Settlement, and new rates went into effect on May 28, 2010. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposes a revenue increase of approximately $50.0 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which includes adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. New rates are expected to be effective by May 2011, subject to refund. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011, a stipulation and settlement agreement was filed that provides for the merger and settlement of the rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indianas existing services, rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indianas rates in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million, when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Bear Garden Station. In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2010, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced or completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area and capable of providing market access to more than 500,000 Dth per day of natural gas. East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all of the facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Compressor Station expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that mature December 15, 2040. On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80% notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1 million of 2016 notes were successfully tendered. On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes. On September 14, 2010, the company completed a $400 million equity offering of common stock. This offering was structured as a forward equity agreement. Refer to Note 14, Common Stock, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this transaction. On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March 15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share for the same period in 2009. Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items: Electric Operations net revenues increased $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased $18.5 million primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues from growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million. The effective tax rate decreased to 32.4% compared to 41.8% for the comparable period last year. The decrease is due to NiSource recording a $15.2 million reduction in income tax expense in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of a rate case settlement by Columbia of Pennsylvania that requires the company to flow through certain tax benefits to customers in current rates. Additionally, the company experienced increases in income tax expense in 2009 for additional deferred income tax expense related to state apportionment changes. Increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following item: On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance finalized a cash tender offer for $273.1 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due in 2016. As a result of this tender offer, NiSource incurred $96.7 million in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, which is recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt. These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSources four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth continue to comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and expense management. Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters. NiSource is moving forward with regulatory initiatives across several gas distribution company markets, at Northern Indiana, and at Columbia Gulf. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches, NiSources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on long term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure. On November 19, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges. The filing requests an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross revenue of $75.7 million when compared to a normalized test year ended June 30, 2010. This is calculated to provide the opportunity to earn a return of 7.70% on net original cost rate base of $2,706 million. If approved, the rates from this new petition would replace any other existing rates, including those that may be approved by effect of the August 25, 2010 rate order for the 2008 rate case. The proposed rates would ease bill impacts on residential customers, while still allowing Northern Indiana 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. to continue investing in service, reliability and infrastructure improvements. Northern Indiana filed the proceeding under the IURCs minimum standard filing requirements prescribing timeframes for issuance of an order if required information is supplied as part of the rate case filing. The IURC held its prehearing conference on December 17, 2010 and issued a prehearing conference order on January 5, 2011. The parties agreed to and the IURC ordered a procedural schedule that includes a bifurcated hearing. The evidentiary hearing on Northern Indianas case in chief is scheduled for the week of February 28, 2011, and the evidentiary hearing for the remainder of the case is scheduled for the weeks of July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2011. The case is scheduled to be fully briefed by September 30, 2011 and an Order is anticipated by the end of 2011 with the implementation of new rates anticipated in the first quarter of 2012. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually, and seeking to implement a levelized distribution charge for its residential class that would mitigate revenue volatility associated with volumetric rates and provide residential customers with clear price signals. Columbia of Pennsylvania expects that the Pennsylvania PUC will issue an order in the third or fourth quarter of 2011 with rates going into effect in the fourth quarter. On May 3, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a natural gas rate case with the IURC. Northern Indiana entered into a comprehensive settlement with all parties on August 24, 2010. The Settlement Agreement was approved in entirety by Order issued on November 4, 2010 and new rates were placed into effect November 5, 2010. The order resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $14.9 million when compared to a normalized test year ended December 31, 2009. The IURC authorized Northern Indiana to increase the monthly fixed charge for residential customers from $6.36 to $11.00. The IURC also approved revised depreciation accrual rates for gas plant and authorized Northern Indiana to reduce current period gas plant depreciation expense by up to $25.7 million annually for the next four years or until further order of the IURC, whichever occurs first. On May 3, 2010, Columbia of Virginia filed a base rate case with the VSCC seeking an annual revenue increase of $13.0 million to recover an updated level of costs upon the expiration of its Performance Based Regulation Plan on December 31, 2010. Columbia of Virginia also sought a Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA), cost recovery of certain gas related items through its Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism rather than base rates, and forward looking adjustments predicted to occur during the rate year ending December 31, 2011. On November 16, 2010, Columbia of Virginia, the VSCC Staff and the other parties filed a Proposed Stipulation and Recommendation (Stipulation) that would result in an annual revenue increase of $4.9 million, including authorization of the WNA and recovery of certain gas related items through the PGA mechanism. The Chief Hearing Examiner issued a Report on December 2, 2010 recommending approval of the Stipulation. The VSCC issued a Final Order on December 17, 2010 adopting the Stipulation. New rates became effective January 1, 2011. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC. On June 25, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania and the other active parties filed a Joint Petition for Settlement that would result in an annual revenue increase of $12.0 million. On August 18, 2010, the Pennsylvania PUC entered a final order approving the Joint Petition for Settlement and new rates went into effect on October 1, 2010. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking a revenue increase of $2.2 million annually in order for Columbia of Maryland to earn the rate of return authorized by the PSC in its 2008 rate case. On May 10, 2010, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $1.7 million. The Maryland PSC issued a final order approving the Settlement, and new rates went into effect on May 28, 2010. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposes a revenue increase of approximately $50.0 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which includes adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. New rates are expected to be effective by May 2011, subject to refund. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011, a stipulation and settlement agreement was filed that provides for the merger and settlement of the rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indianas existing services, rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indianas rates in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million, when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Bear Garden Station. In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2010, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced or completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area and capable of providing market access to more than 500,000 Dth per day of natural gas. East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all of the facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Compressor Station expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that mature December 15, 2040. On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80% notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1 million of 2016 notes were successfully tendered. On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes. On September 14, 2010, the company completed a $400 million equity offering of common stock. This offering was structured as a forward equity agreement. Refer to Note 14, Common Stock, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this transaction. On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March 15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. to continue investing in service, reliability and infrastructure improvements. Northern Indiana filed the proceeding under the IURCs minimum standard filing requirements prescribing timeframes for issuance of an order if required information is supplied as part of the rate case filing. The IURC held its prehearing conference on December 17, 2010 and issued a prehearing conference order on January 5, 2011. The parties agreed to and the IURC ordered a procedural schedule that includes a bifurcated hearing. The evidentiary hearing on Northern Indianas case in chief is scheduled for the week of February 28, 2011, and the evidentiary hearing for the remainder of the case is scheduled for the weeks of July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2011. The case is scheduled to be fully briefed by September 30, 2011 and an Order is anticipated by the end of 2011 with the implementation of new rates anticipated in the first quarter of 2012. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually, and seeking to implement a levelized distribution charge for its residential class that would mitigate revenue volatility associated with volumetric rates and provide residential customers with clear price signals. Columbia of Pennsylvania expects that the Pennsylvania PUC will issue an order in the third or fourth quarter of 2011 with rates going into effect in the fourth quarter. On May 3, 2010, Northern Indiana filed a natural gas rate case with the IURC. Northern Indiana entered into a comprehensive settlement with all parties on August 24, 2010. The Settlement Agreement was approved in entirety by Order issued on November 4, 2010 and new rates were placed into effect November 5, 2010. The order resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $14.9 million when compared to a normalized test year ended December 31, 2009. The IURC authorized Northern Indiana to increase the monthly fixed charge for residential customers from $6.36 to $11.00. The IURC also approved revised depreciation accrual rates for gas plant and authorized Northern Indiana to reduce current period gas plant depreciation expense by up to $25.7 million annually for the next four years or until further order of the IURC, whichever occurs first. On May 3, 2010, Columbia of Virginia filed a base rate case with the VSCC seeking an annual revenue increase of $13.0 million to recover an updated level of costs upon the expiration of its Performance Based Regulation Plan on December 31, 2010. Columbia of Virginia also sought a Weather Normalization Adjustment (WNA), cost recovery of certain gas related items through its Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism rather than base rates, and forward looking adjustments predicted to occur during the rate year ending December 31, 2011. On November 16, 2010, Columbia of Virginia, the VSCC Staff and the other parties filed a Proposed Stipulation and Recommendation (Stipulation) that would result in an annual revenue increase of $4.9 million, including authorization of the WNA and recovery of certain gas related items through the PGA mechanism. The Chief Hearing Examiner issued a Report on December 2, 2010 recommending approval of the Stipulation. The VSCC issued a Final Order on December 17, 2010 adopting the Stipulation. New rates became effective January 1, 2011. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC. On June 25, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania and the other active parties filed a Joint Petition for Settlement that would result in an annual revenue increase of $12.0 million. On August 18, 2010, the Pennsylvania PUC entered a final order approving the Joint Petition for Settlement and new rates went into effect on October 1, 2010. On January 28, 2010, Columbia of Maryland filed a base rate case with the Maryland PSC, seeking a revenue increase of $2.2 million annually in order for Columbia of Maryland to earn the rate of return authorized by the PSC in its 2008 rate case. On May 10, 2010, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Stipulation and Settlement Agreement that would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $1.7 million. The Maryland PSC issued a final order approving the Settlement, and new rates went into effect on May 28, 2010. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposes a revenue increase of approximately $50.0 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which includes adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. New rates are expected to be effective by May 2011, subject to refund. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011, a stipulation and settlement agreement was filed that provides for the merger and settlement of the rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indianas existing services, rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indianas rates in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million, when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Bear Garden Station. In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2010, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced or completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area and capable of providing market access to more than 500,000 Dth per day of natural gas. East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all of the facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Compressor Station expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that mature December 15, 2040. On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80% notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1 million of 2016 notes were successfully tendered. On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes. On September 14, 2010, the company completed a $400 million equity offering of common stock. This offering was structured as a forward equity agreement. Refer to Note 14, Common Stock, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this transaction. On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March 15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. On September 1, 2010 Northern Indiana, NIFL and Kokomo filed to merge into one company (Northern Indiana). NIFL and Kokomo also filed rate proceedings on September 1, 2010. On February 23, 2011, a stipulation and settlement agreement was filed that provides for the merger and settlement of the rate proceedings. The settlement stipulates that all of Northern Indianas existing services, rates and charges will be applicable in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories, including one unified Gas Cost Adjustment mechanism. The application of Northern Indianas rates in the former NIFL and Kokomo territories will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.8 million, when compared to a normalized test year ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily offset by reductions in depreciation expense. A settlement hearing is scheduled for March 23, 2011 and an order is anticipated in the second quarter of 2011. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Bear Garden Station. In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2010, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations advanced or completed more than $150 million in strategic growth projects serving the Marcellus Shale production area and capable of providing market access to more than 500,000 Dth per day of natural gas. East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all of the facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Compressor Station expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that mature December 15, 2040. On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80% notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1 million of 2016 notes were successfully tendered. On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes. On September 14, 2010, the company completed a $400 million equity offering of common stock. This offering was structured as a forward equity agreement. Refer to Note 14, Common Stock, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this transaction. On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March 15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter of 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On December 8, 2010, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes that mature December 15, 2040. On December 1, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that it was commencing a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.80% notes due 2019. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2019 notes were accepted. On December 14, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $272.9 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource Finance increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2016 notes it would purchase from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and terminated the portion of the tender offer related to its 6.80% notes due 2019. On December 30, 2010, NiSource Finance announced that $273.1 million of 2016 notes were successfully tendered. On November 15, 2010, NiSource Finance redeemed $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes. On September 14, 2010, the company completed a $400 million equity offering of common stock. This offering was structured as a forward equity agreement. Refer to Note 14, Common Stock, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this transaction. On March 15, 2010, Columbia of Pennsylvania entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables, as they originate, to CPRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia of Pennsylvania. CPRC, in turn, is party to an agreement with BTMU, also dated March 15, 2010, under the terms of which it sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in its accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. sponsored by BTMU. The maximum seasonal program limit under the terms of the agreement is $75 million. CPRCs agreement with the commercial paper conduit has a scheduled termination date of March 14, 2011 and can be renewed if mutually agreed to by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, $46.6 million of accounts receivable had been transferred by CPRC. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per basic share, compared to $230.5 million, or $0.84 per basic share in 2009. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $370.6 million, or $1.35 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2010 net income of $292.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, 2009 net income of $217.7 million, or $0.79 per basic share, and 2008 net income of $79.0 million, or $0.29 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for the 2010 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2009 period, an increase in operating expenses of $16.3 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These fluctuations in 2010 and in 2009 were largely attributable to the changes in the recovery of uncollectible accounts. Net Revenues NiSource analyzes the operating results using net revenues. Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, were $3,447.9 million, a $115.3 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $121.5 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues increased as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense and $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due to lower regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract of $5.7 million established at Columbia of Massachusetts, customer credits of $5.6 million issued as a result of a rate case, and a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $3,332.6 million, an $85.7 million increase compared with 2008. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $66.7 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues of $65.4 million, partially offset by lower Electric Operations net revenues of $41.0 million. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of $97.2 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings, partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of $22.0 million, a $13.0 million decrease in off system sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million, shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million and mineral rights leasing of $12.2 million. The increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion, the Ohio Storage Expansion and new Appalachian supply contracts. Electric Operations net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial usage of $17.4 million, which was significantly impacted by economic conditions, lower capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, $9.1 million of lower off system sales and $9.5 million lower emission allowance sales, partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power of $10.1 million. The 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008. Production decreased sharply in October 2008, bottoming near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,541.6 million in 2010, a decrease of $6.0 million from the comparable 2009 period. This decrease was primarily due to decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million, decreased legal reserves of $12.0 million, and decreased trackers of $7.5 million, offset in net revenues. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase of $36.1 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.0 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. Operating expenses were $2,547.6 million in 2009, an increase of $207.4 million from the comparable 2008 period. This increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of $102.3 million, which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of $84.8 million, net of deferring $10.7 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to Columbia of Ohio in July 2009, and higher payroll and benefits expense of $29.6 million. Operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of $27.2 million, impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2009, higher depreciation of $22.0 million, $21.6 million in increased legal reserves, and increased trackers of $16.3 million offset in net revenues. The increase in benefits expense is due in part to a $12.7 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008, which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million compared with 2009. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $16.0 million in 2009 compared to $12.3 million in 2008. Equity earnings from Millennium, which was placed into service on December 22, 2008, totaled $12.1 million for 2009, net of an $8.1 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to Millenniums decision to delay permanent financing until 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Other Income (Deductions) in 2009 reduced income $405.2 million compared to a reduction of $362.4 million in 2008. Interest expense increased primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $700 million of long term debt in May 2008, the issuance of $600 million of long term debt in March 2009 and a $385 million two year term loan entered into in April 2009, partially offset by the open market repurchase of $100 million of long term debt in January 2009, the $250.6 million tender offer repurchase of long term debt in April 2009 and lower short term interest rates. Other, net was a loss of $1.4 million compared to income of $17.6 million for 2008 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 62 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009. On August 27, 2008, NiSource Development Company sold its interest in JOF Transportation Company to Lehigh Service Corporation for a pre tax gain of $16.7 million. JOF Transportation Company held a 40% interest in Chicago South Shore South Bend Railroad Co. and a 40% interest in Indiana Illinois Development Company, LLC. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 41.8%, and 33.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 9.4% decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the 2010 rate settlements resulting in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. In 2009, the company recorded in its tax provision the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million, additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes, and a reduction in AFUDC Equity that increased tax expense by $3.2 million. In 2008, the effective tax rate was reduced by $14.9 million for the change in Massachusetts state taxes discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense results from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. During the third quarter of 2008, the Governor of Massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the Massachusetts corporate income tax regime. Under the law, which became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, NiSource calculates its Massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis, meaning that the income tax obligation to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of NiSources income, rather than just the income of NiSources subsidiaries doing business in Massachusetts. Because of NiSources substantial operations outside of Massachusetts, the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to Massachusetts. NiSource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a $14.9 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million reduction in income tax expense in 2008. Income tax expense for 2009 and 2010 reflects the impact of the law on a prospective basis. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009, and a loss of $291.6 million, or $1.06 loss per basic share, in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. The loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the Tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year. During 2008 NiSource recorded an after tax loss of $108.2 million for the dispositions of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities, Granite State Gas and Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $4.4 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2011. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from a year ago. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $250.4 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $324.4 million source of working capital. Although there have been no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.5 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Tawney Settlement. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. The Trial Court entered its Order discharging the judgment on January 20, 2009 and is supervising the administration of the settlement proceeds. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, NiSource contributed $53.2 million, $252.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, into the qualified settlement fund which is recorded as net operating activities used for discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately an additional $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource will be required to make additional payments, pursuant to the settlement, upon notice from the Class Administrator.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2010, NiSource contributed $161.8 million to its pension plans and $50.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2010, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $578.4 million and $429.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc.

(in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 Gas Distribution Operations $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 327.5 302.0 287.4 383.8 Electric Operations 258.4 190.3 162.6 552.4 Corporate and Other Operations 23.0 9.6 5.4 0.7 Total $ 1,100.0 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 $ 1,306.6 For 2011, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,100.0 million, which is $188.4 million higher than the 2010 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations is primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. For 2009, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $798.6 million, a decrease of $508.0 million versus 2008. A significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within Electric Operations of $389.8 million, due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of Sugar Creek. Capital expenditures decreased within Gas Distribution Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $26.5 million and $96.4 million, respectively. The decrease within Gas Distribution Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on maintenance activities. The decrease within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment was primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects relative to 2008. In 2008, NiSource received proceeds from the sale of Whiting Clean Energy, Northern Utilities, and Granite State of $216.7 million, $187.3 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Since these businesses were reported as discontinued operations, these amounts are included within, Net Investing Activities from Discontinued Operations, on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. On May 30, 2008, Northern Indiana purchased Sugar Creek for approximately $330 million to address the need for additional capacity. Restricted cash was $202.9 million and $174.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within NiSources risk management and energy marketing activities. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million, $62.7 million, and $46.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Contributions to equity investees were $87.9 million, $26.4 million, and $39.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. NiSource Finance maintains a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which has a termination date of July 7, 2011. This facility provides a reasonable cushion of short term liquidity for general corporate purposes including meeting cash requirements driven by volatility in natural gas prices, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. NiSource currently intends to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. During September 2008, NiSource Finance entered into an additional $500 million six month revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital that was originally due to expire on March 23, 2009. However, on February 13, 2009, the six month credit facility was terminated in conjunction with the closing of a new two year bank term loan. The two year term loan was subsequently repaid in December 2009 with proceeds from the December 4, 2009, $500.0 million debt offering. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%, and borrowings of $103.0 million at December 31, 2009, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.59%. The increase in borrowings compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the maturity of $681.8 million of its 7.875% unsecured notes in November of 2010 and the cash tender offer of $273.1 million of its 10.75% notes due 2016 and the related early redemption premiums. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, NiSource Finance had $32.5 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $14.2 million and $85.0 million were under the five year revolving credit facility. A letter of credit of $254 million was issued on January 13, 2009 to cover payments related to the Tawney settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of $378.3 million of credit was available under the credit facility. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its five year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 59.9%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also include a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 14, 2010, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 19, 2010, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $18.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The table below excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long term debt and current interest payments on long term debt. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2010 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After Long term debt $ 5,951.8 $ 27.7 $ 315.9 $ 613.9 $ 561.9 $ 230.0 $ 4,202.4 Capital leases 51.9 9.2 9.0 7.5 7.5 6.4 12.3 Interest payments on long term debt 2,943.0 369.4 367.2 321.9 301.6 285.5 1,297.4 Operating leases 194.6 39.5 33.1 26.1 22.3 14.2 59.4 Energy commodity contracts 640.1 258.3 124.2 101.7 76.8 79.1 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,662.5 257.4 253.9 197.6 162.9 147.9 642.8 IBM service obligations 399.9 94.4 90.4 89.2 86.4 39.5 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 53.7 12.1 12.0 11.9 11.8 5.9 Other service obligations 202.8 143.4 53.6 5.8 Other liabilities 158.0 158.0 Total contractual obligations $ 12,258.3 $ 1,369.4 $ 1,259.3 $ 1,375.6 $ 1,231.2 $ 808.5 $ 6,214.3 NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2010. For 2011, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $399.6 million, which includes $369.4 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, NiSource also had $1,382.5 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring semi annual payments of $2.9 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. On December 12, 2007, NiSource Corporate Services amended its agreement with IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM for the amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended Agreement, at December 31, 2010, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $400 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. In February 2011, NiSource elected to reduce certain services which will effectively lower the service obligation by approximately $30 million over the remaining service agreement. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $53.7 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining four and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $12.4 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with three major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2013 and are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual commitments. NiSources expected payments included within, Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2011. Plan contributions beyond 2011 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2011, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $149.7 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. million to its pension plans and approximately $49.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $6.0 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability is up to $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement, which was terminated on December 29, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2010, $8.3 million of the maximum settlement liability had not been paid. NiSource has contributed approximately $2.7 million subsequent to December 31, 2010. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $313.4 million in 2011, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $195 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 62 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. During 2010 and 2009, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. No amounts were reclassified in 2010 or 2008. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.8 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $14.7 million and $19.2 million for the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 62 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. As discussed below, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. The parent company of one of NiSources interest rate swap counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2008, which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between NiSource Finance and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result, on September 15, 2008, NiSource Finance terminated the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional value of $110 million. The mark to market close out value of this swap at the September 15, 2008 termination date was determined to be $4.8 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange 40 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.3 million and zero during 2010, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $1,802.2 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, and $1,882.4 million and $1,602.6 million at December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NiSource Inc. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 62 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $335.4 million at December 31, 2010. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $399.8 million and $410.9 million of price risk management assets, of which $61.1 million and $68.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $355.5 million and $360.3 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $1.2 million and $1.5 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2010 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. The goodwill balance also includes $13.3 million for Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and $5.5 million for Kokomo Gas. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2010. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. For example, with regard to NiSources discount rate assumptions used in the June 30, 2010 test results, a 1% change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the Columbia Distribution Operations and Columbia Transmission Operations reporting units by approximately $1.2 billion for both the Columbia Distribution and Columbia Transmission operations. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2010, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Revenue. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will materially impact NiSource. International Financial Reporting Standards In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and reported, among other things, that many large jurisdictions using IFRS have adopted IFRS by either converging their local standards to IFRS (convergence approach) or by endorsing individual standards over time (endorsement approach). The SEC is expected to vote in the second half of 2011 on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Additionally, in December 2010 the SEC chairman publicly stated that companies would be allowed a minimum of four years to adjust if the use of IFRS is mandated. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 46 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had 7,604 employees of whom 3,278 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These agreements expire at various times beginning in September 2011 through June 2015. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Bill The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Many regulations will be issued to implement the Act over the next twelve to twenty four months. NiSource is currently reviewing the Act and is unable to determine the final impact that the Act will have on its operations until these regulations have been issued. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NiSource Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7.

Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Competition Gas Distribution Operations competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. Market Conditions During 2010, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices for the winter of 2010 2011 have primarily been in the $3.36 $4.91/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.00 $6.50/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2009 2010. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2010 2011 winter season, storage levels were 13 Bcf and 327 Bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels, respectively. During the summer of 2010, prices ranged between $3.30 and $5.17/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2009. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 75.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 $ 75.8 Maintenance and Other 415.6 315.6 257.1 293.9 Total $ 491.1 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 $ 369.7 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $409.7 million in 2010 and are projected to be $491.1 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) increase in the capital expenditures budget from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to additional spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately $26.5 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies have experienced an increase in usage by industrial customers due to improved general economic conditions. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. Columbia of Ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and NiSource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sale of Northern Utilities On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. Northern Utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Northern Utilities as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of $0.5 million and net income of $6.2 million for Northern Utilities, which affected the Gas Distribution Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact in 2010. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. NiSource acquired Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas in 1999 as part of the companys larger acquisition of Columbia of Massachusetts. NiSource is retaining its ownership of Columbia of Massachusetts as a core component of the companys long term, investment driven growth strategy. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3% warmer than 2008, decreasing net revenues by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 831.0 MMDth, compared to 923.2 MMDth for 2008. This decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather and lower industrial usage due to the economys slowdown and lower off system sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to non traditional customers. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Net revenues for 2009 were $1,609.4 million, an increase of $66.7 million from 2008. This increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of $97.2 million and increased trackers of $4.9 million offset in expense, partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer margins of $22.0 million, lower off system sales revenues of $13.0 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $8 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $270.6 million and a revenue decrease of $121.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Operating Income For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.7 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $11.8 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. For 2009, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $327.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of $75.0 million, partially offset by increased net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of $44.6 million, increased depreciation expense of $19.3 million, higher uncollectible costs of $5.5 million, increased net regulatory and tax trackers of $4.9 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of $3.6 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $31.8 million, net of the $10.7 million deferral of increased pension cost for Columbia of Ohio. 51 ITEM 7.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

Growth Projects Placed into Service Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continues the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service on May 17, 2010. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This third project is expected to go in service in the first quarter 2011. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Clendenin Project. Construction began in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin area in West Virginia to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project allows Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 130,000 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that will begin in the second quarter 2011. Total capital required for the Clendenin project is approximately $18 million. Projects Placed into Service in 2009. During 2009, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment placed a number of projects into service. The Line 1570 project allowed Columbia Transmission to gather and transport phased in gas volumes of up to 150,000 Dth per day in October 2008 and March 2009, with facilities substantially completed and incremental volumes delivered in fourth quarter of 2009 and during 2010. The Columbia Penn project provided phased in access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the Marcellus Shale formation that underlies Columbia Transmissions transmission and storage network in the region in February and November 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion project allowed Columbia Transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities, adding 97,000 Dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability beginning on April 1, 2009. The Ohio Storage project expanded two Ohio storage fields, adding capacity of nearly 7 Bcf and 103,400 Dth per day of deliverability beginning in May 2009 with full service achieved during the fourth quarter of 2009 under FERC authorized market based rates. The Appalachian Expansion project included a new compressor station and added 100,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity beginning on July 1, 2009. The Easton Compressor Station project increased delivery capacity of 30,000 Dth per day commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Eastern Market Expansion, Ohio Storage, and Appalachian Expansion projects are all fully subscribed on a firm basis. Growth Projects in Progress East Lateral Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $4.7 million project in 2010 that, with modification of existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral, allows it to provide firm transportation services for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day have been executed for five year terms. Gas Transmission and Storage received FERC approval to complete this project, which will be put into service on April 1, 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding its WB system through an approximately $14 million investment in additional facilities to provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion will allow producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity have been executed, some of which began in January 2011. Gas Transmission and Storage requested and received FERC approval and anticipates completing construction on all facilities in the third quarter of 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. As a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is expanding Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis. This additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities will be constructed at a cost of nearly $4 million. The segment requested and received FERC approval to complete this project with service expected to commence in April 2011. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7.

(in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 152.9 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 $ 253.4 Maintenance and Other 174.6 149.6 116.2 130.4 Total $ 327.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 $ 383.8 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 are projected to be approximately $327.5 million, which is an increase of $25.5 million over 2010. The increase in Maintenance and Other from 2010 to 2011 is attributable to Integrity Management Pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2009, decreased by $96.4 million relative to 2008, primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2010, approximately 91.2% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 5.6% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts. This is compared to approximately 89.3% of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 3.8% of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for 2009. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2010 and 2009, approximately 3.2% and 6.9%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $6.2 million, $12.2 million and $47.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in reconstruction costs. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million and $30.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. Hurricanes In 2004 and 2005, hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita damaged certain Columbia Gulf property, including pipeline assets and related facilities. In 2009, Columbia Gulf incurred $2.6 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes, bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly $59 million over a multi year period, which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance. Costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred. Insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in December 2008 for $40.8 million, of which $11.5 million and $16.8 million in proceeds was received in 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007. Insurance proceeds covered capital replacement, operation and maintenance losses, and business interruption, fuel costs and other losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for hurricane damages. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Sale of Granite State Gas On December 1, 2008, NiSource completed its sale of Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas to Unitil Corporation. The final sale amount was $209.1 million, which included $49.1 million in working capital. The working capital amount was adjusted based upon the final settlement that occurred in the first quarter of 2009. Granite State Gas is an 86 mile FERC regulated gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Granite State Gas as discontinued operations. As such, net income of $0.6 million from continuing operations for Granite State Gas, which affected the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment, was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. There was no effect to net income from discontinued operations for 2010 or 2009. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011. (in millions) 2011E 2010 2009 2008 System Growth $ 85.9 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 $ 376.1 Maintenance and Other 172.5 164.5 129.9 176.3 Total $ 258.4 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 $ 552.4 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 were higher by $27.7 million versus 2009. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2010, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an $8.3 million adjustment recorded by Northern Indiana during the second quarter of 2008. 61 ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth for the same period in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter have helped keep overall system volumes comparable with the prior year. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above has helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with last year. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,391.4 MMDth for 2009, compared to 1,488.5 MMDth in 2008. The decrease of 97.1 MMDth is due primarily to lower Columbia Gulf deliveries partially offset by increased Columbia Transmission volumes transported from new Columbia Transmission contracts. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Operating revenues were $930.7 million for 2009, an increase of $65.4 million from 2008. The increase in operating revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of $29.5 million principally from growth projects such as the Eastern Market Expansion and the Ohio Storage Expansion, as well as for new Appalachian supply contracts, increased shorter term transportation and storage services of $18.6 million, mineral rights leasing revenues of $12.2 million, increased trackers of $9.2 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of $9.0 million that occurred in 2008, partially offset by the impact of $5.3 million of contract buyouts in 2008. Operating Income Operating income of $377.1 million in 2010 decreased $11.4 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.9 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Operating income of $388.5 million in 2009 increased $18.8 million from 2008, primarily due to increased net revenues described above and higher equity earnings of $3.7 million, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of $50.3 million. Operating expenses increased as a result of restructuring charges of $19.9 million, $9.2 million of increased trackers offset in net revenues, higher capacity lease costs of $6.6 million, higher maintenance costs of $4.0 million and higher environmental expenses of $4.0 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million net gain on the sale of certain offshore assets of Columbia Gulf. Equity earnings increased by $3.7 million primarily resulting from higher earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in 56 ITEM 7.

Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing and construction demand, industry consolidation, increased steelmaking capacity in China and India, and gross margin volatility. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indiana Electrics service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008, 2009 and 2010 and estimates for 2011.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $258.4 million in 2011, which is an increase of $68.1 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by $389.8 million compared to 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Sugar Creek in 2008. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 has resulted in an increase in sales. Electric Operations sales were 15,525.7 gwh for the year 2009, a decrease of 1,916.8 gwh compared to 2008. The decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather. Industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17%, primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies production in October 2008, which bottomed near 50% in May 2009. Since then, NiSource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers. Net Revenues Electric Operations net revenues were $886.4 million for 2010, an increase of $121.5 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement and an increase in residential margins of $6.6 million. Electric Operations net revenues were $764.9 million for 2009, a decrease of $41.0 million from 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately $18 million, lower industrial margins of $17.4 million mainly due to economic conditions, lower Sugar Creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the PJM Interconnection of $13.5 million, lower emission allowance sales of $9.5 million and lower off system sales of $9.1 million. These decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial margins of $12.4 million and lower non recoverable purchased power costs of $10.1 million. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a revenue increase of $54.9 million and a revenue reduction of $20.2 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2010 was $235.5 million, an increase of $118.8 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.4 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, a $6.0 million reduction in the environmental reserve, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. Operating income for 2009 was $116.7 million, a decrease of $102.5 million from 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of $61.5 million and lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of $51.1 million, increased legal reserves of $13.0 million, higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of $6.2 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of $6.3 million, lower environmental expense of $5.4 million and lower depreciation of $4.0 million. The increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of $42.6 million. The decrease in 60 ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. With the effects of the present economy, existing resources are projected to be sufficient through 2012 to serve customers needs. Therefore, Northern Indianas two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power issued on October 24, 2008 were not acted upon. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Electric Operations (continued) With numerous variables contributing to uncertainty in the near term outlook, Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. On July 24, 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables for wind generated power from Iowa and South Dakota. Under these agreements Northern Indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. Although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established, Northern Indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard. Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to the steel related industry accounted for approximately 63.6% and 62.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The industrial sales volumes and revenues recovered in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to the partial economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2009 recession lows.
